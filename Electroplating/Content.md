PREFACE.

This Handbook contains, in a form convenient for
everyday use, a comprehensive digest of the information
on Electro-plating, scattered over more than twenty
thousand columns of Work--one of the weekly
journals it is my fortune to edit--and supplies concise
information on the details of the subjects on which
it treats.

In preparing for publication in book form the mass
of relevant matter contained in the volumes of Work,
much had to be arranged anew. However, it may be
mentioned that a number of articles by Mr. G. E.
Bonney have been incorporated in the text.

Readers who may desire additional information
respecting special details of the matters dealt with in
this Handbook, or instructions on kindred subjects,
should address a question to Work, so that it may
be answered in the columns of that journal.

ELECTRO-PLATING.

CHAPTER I.

INTRODUCTION: TANKS, VATS, AND OTHER APPARATUS.

Electro-plating is the process by which a metal
or alloy held in solution by a liquid is deposited
electrically on a prepared surface. From the  solution,
the metal (nickel, silver, brass, copper, etc.)
is thrown on to the object receiving the deposit,
and simultaneously an equal quantity of a similar
metal to that held in solution is fretted off from
metal plates (anodes) suspended in the electro-plating
bath. Thus, although the solution is being
constantly robbed of metal, it is yet being fed,
and so its strength is maintained. Of course, the
anodes must be plates of similar metal to that
contained in solution; thus, nickel anodes in a
nickel solution, silver anodes in a silver solution,
and so on.

Anode is the name given by Dr. Faraday to the
positive plate or wire in a solution undergoing
electrolysis. It is derived from two Greek words:
ana, meaning "upwards"; and odos, "a way"--
the way in which the sun rises--and is an indication
that the current rises from the battery to enter
the electro-plating solution, this way being from
the negative element of the battery to the positive
element in the solution to be electrolysed (see the
arrows in Fig. 1). The negative element of a
battery receives the electric current immediately
it is generated, and transmits it to the anode

[Page.]

placed in the electro-plating bath; the negative
element is, therefore, the positive pole, and its
connection to the anode by a wire makes the anode
the positive pole or element in the solution. By
way of illustration: the carbon element in a
Bunsen battery (see pp. 28 to 30) is the negative
element, because it receives the electric current
generated by the positive, or zinc, element of the
battery; but it is also the positive pole, because,
through it and its metal connections, the current
is transmitted to work outside the battery. Fig. 1
shows at a glance what is meant.

Another scientific term has now to be referred
to. Anion is a term invented by Dr. Faraday to
indicate the radical of an acid, or the portion of a
salt set free at the anode during electrolysis. It
has been defined as "the electro-negative, or
chlorous radical of the acid or salt decomposed."
Assume that a solution of the double cyanide of
silver and potassium is being used in the work of
electro-plating. The salt of silver in this solution
is combined with a salt of potassium, and three
distinct substances are present, apart from the
water which holds them all in solution; these are
--silver, potassium, and cyanogen. When the
electric current is passing through the solution
in the process of plating, silver and potassium are
set free at the goods being plated, and cyanogen
is set free at the silver anode. The salt is thus
broken up or decomposed, and cyanogen is the
anion of this salt.

Anodes may be soluble or insoluble in an
electrolyte, as may be required to suit the nature
of the work in hand. Insoluble anodes are used
when it is wished to decompose an electrolyte,
and break it up into its several component parts
without adding another element to it, as when
acidulated water is decomposed by the electric
current to form oxygen and hydrogen--in which
case a platinum anode is used, because platinum

[Page.]

is not soluble in the acidulated solution.
Insoluble anodes are also used when it is wished to
extract all the metal from its solution, and deposit
it in a pure condition on the cathode (the article
plated). Anodes are said to be insoluble when
they are made of elements which are neither
soluble in the solution to be electrolysed, nor can
be made soluble therein under the influence of the
electric current. Some solutions of the acids and
alkalis will act very feebly, or not at all, on an
element, even when heated to boiling point, but

[Fig. 1.--Diagram showing Positions of Anode and Cathode in Electro-plating.]

will dissolve it freely when a current of electricity
is passed from it through the intractable solutions.
For instance, gold is only feebly soluble in a strong
solution of potassium cyanide when exposed to
air, even when the solution is heated; but it is
freely soluble in the same solution when only a
feeble current of electricity is passed from it
through the solution. Insoluble anodes are
generally made of platinum or carbon.

Soluble anodes are used when it is wished to
maintain an electrolyte (the plating solution) at its

[Page.]

original strength--that is, to contain the same
quantity of metal in the solution after it has been
worked as it had when first made up. To do this,
the anode must be only soluble in the solution
whilst the current is passing, and then only to an
extent equal to the rate of metal deposited.
Unless an equivalent of metal is dissolved from the
anode for each equivalent of metal deposited at
the cathode, the original composition of the
solution cannot be maintained during the process of
electrolysis or plating.

The cathode is the opposite of the anode, the
term being derived from the Greek kata, meaning
"down," and odos, "a way." Thus the word signifies
that the current passes down to it from the
anode; the current returns to the negative pole
of the battery attached to the positive plate, thus
completing the electrical circuit. The object being
plated forms the cathode; and just as the anode
is connected electrically to the battery's positive
pole, so is the cathode connected to the negative
pole.

For the present, this is all the theory of the
process of electrolysis that it is desirable to
explain, further information being given as the
practice of electro-plating is dwelt upon. It must
not be inferred from the theoretic explanation
just given that electro-plating consists merely in
taking any metal article, making the necessary
connections, immersing the article in the solution,
and then taking it out bright with its new coat of
deposited metal. There is much to be understood
before successful plating can be accomplished;
the appliances necessary for work on a big scale
are many and expensive; and the manipulation of
the various metals calls for a special knowledge
of the characteristics of each one. This handbook
will deal with many matters of importance
to the electro-plater, and will discuss, in the order
in which the items are here mentioned, the electro-

[Page.]

plater's shop, tanks, vats, and other general
requisites; batteries, dynamos, and electrical
accessories; the appliances for preparing the rough
metal surfaces to receive the electro-deposited
coat, and for polishing the plated ware; the
proper materials, appliances, and methods employed
in electro-plating with silver, copper, gold,
nickel, iron, lead, tin, platinum, and alloys, and the
methods of finishing plated goods.

Persons desiring a small plating plant for the
purpose of treating trinkets, miscellaneous small
articles of the nature of spoons, forks, etc., need
not be deterred from carrying out their wishes by
the magnitude of the operations or by the expense
of the apparatus described in this and succeeding
chapters. Metal can be polished by hand to
look almost as bright as machine-polished metal,
using the same polishing materials and suitable
brushes. Small quantities of the same solutions
can also be used in smaller vessels, and gold,
silver, etc., can be deposited in good condition
with current obtained from small cells. It must
be understood, however, that the same strict
attention to absolute cleanliness, and care in
preparation, must be observed in small operations,
and the same rules must guide the worker when
plating a spoon or a screw as when plating the
handle-bar of a bicycle. Readers will find that
special attention is paid to the requirements of the
amateur and small professional plater in later
chapters, their limitations having been taken into
careful consideration.

The plating shop must be well lighted and
ventilated, and kept at a temperature of about
60° F. Good light, preferably from high windows
or from a skylight, is necessary for the examination
of the work; but receptacles containing silver
solutions should be protected from the action of
direct sunlight. Good light is required over the
scouring trough and vats, to enable the workmen

[Page.]

to note changes of colour in the metals; but the
light over the vats should be a northern light if
possible, because sunlight decomposes all plating
solutions. The plating shop should be roomy and
clean, for the most perfect cleanliness in the
process is necessary to success. The plating vats should
be covered with canvas when not in use, to exclude
dust. Ventilation is necessary, because all the
exhalations of gas from the solutions are extremely
poisonous and soon debilitate the strongest
workmen when fresh air is absent. Not only is an
even temperature conducive to regular working of
the solutions, but the employees do better and more
work when the shop is well ventilated and comfortably
warmed.

If the solution vats are placed in a corner of
an ordinary workshop, they will soon get 
contaminated with dust and dirt. If the dynamo is
near the polishing lathe, or where metal dust is
flying about, it will soon be ruined.

Metal castings, forgings, etc., are surfaced for
plating on emery bobs, etc., as will be described
in later chapters; they are then immersed in a
hot solution of caustic potash, to loosen and
remove grease and oil contracted at the polishing
lathe. The solution for this purpose is contained in
a wrought-iron tank, the usual dimensions for which
are 4 ft. by 2 ft. by 1 ft. 9 in., to hold 50 gallons
of liquid; or one for larger work, measuring 5 ft.
by 2 ft., to hold 100 gallons. The size of the tank
will be determined by that of the work, and the
vessel must be large enough to receive the longest
articles likely to be plated. It is made of wrought
iron, which is not attacked by caustic potash.
Tanks of galvanised iron, lead-lined tanks, zinc
tanks, and tanks with soldered joints are
unsuitable, because all these metals and solder are
soluble in caustic potash, which will hold the
dissolved metal in solution and deposit it on any
articles cleaned in the tank.

[Page.]

As the potash solution will have to be worked
hot, the tank must be placed in a position where
it can be conveniently heated, either by steam
passing through a coil of iron pipe in the solution,
by an ordinary furnace in which coal or coke is
burnt, or by gas jets. Steam and gas are preferable
to coal, because the heat can be regulated
to a nicety, and there is no danger from fire after
the day's work is done. Even when heated by
steam, it is advisable to support the tank above
the floor on brickwork to a height suitable for
easy working. The solution is composed of
American potash dissolved in water, at the
strength of 1 lb. to each gallon of water.

The articles are rinsed in hot water after they
are taken from the potash tank, so a second tank,
of equal dimensions and of the same material,
must be fitted up in a similar manner next to
the potash tank. This is kept supplied with clean hot
water.

In the preparation of articles to be plated, the
polisher aims at getting the finest polish obtainable
on the surface of the article; whilst the plater
tries to free the surface from every trace of grease,
oil, sweat, and other foreign matter. The polished
work may be beautifully clean from a polisher's
point of view, and yet be very dirty when viewed
from the plater's point of view. The surface must
be chemically clean before the article is placed
in the plating vat, to ensure the deposited coat of
metal adhering firmly to the surface of the metal
on which it is deposited. The vessel in which the
articles are thus further cleansed is named the
scouring trough or tray, and is shown by Fig. 2.
It consists, as shown, of a shallow trough of thick
wood divided into two parts, lined with lead, and
furnished at one end with a plug and overflow
pipe. In some scouring trays a narrow shelf is
fixed a little below the upper edge, and the work
rests on this whilst being cleaned. Some work-

[Page.]

men hold the work on a piece of board placed
across the tray. The tray must be placed on
strong wooden trestles, at a height to suit the
workman, and kept half full of clean water, to
rinse the articles after scouring.

The plating vat is the name given to the vessel
intended to hold the plating solutions. This vessel
must be roomy enough to take the largest article
likely to be plated in it, and then leave an
abundance of space all round. It is usual to plan
plating vats to hold several such articles at

[Fig. 2. --Scouring Trough.]

once, so that time may be saved. Those in
general use for nickel, copper, brass, and silver-plating,
are made of thick pine-wood, well jointed,
and strengthened with iron bolts across the ends,
lined with sheet-lead put together with burnt
joints, then match-lined to prevent metallic contact
with the lead lining. The appearance of these
vessels when finished is shown by Fig. 3. They
are made in a great number of sizes, the capacities
ranging from 19 gal. to several hundred gallons.

A vat to hold the solution may be of vitreous
stoneware; but this material is liable to fracture,

[Page.]

and is not easily made into large rectangular
vessels. The next best is enamelled iron, which,
being smooth, retards the creeping action of the
cyanide salts, so that the sides of the vat are kept
clean, and enamelled iron vats are suitable for small
work; their use is almost compulsory when the
solution must be used hot. In large plating
establishments the vats are wood, lined with
lead, as already mentioned.

Plating vats constructed of thick slate slabs,
grooved and well bolted together, are also sold
for the purpose, but apparently they cost 50 per

Fig. 3.--Plating-Vat.

cent, more than the lead-lined wood vats. Vats
made of iron only, unless they are lined with
thick enamel, are altogether unsuitable as plating
vats; copper, brass, iron, and zinc are readily
corroded by the action of the acid or the alkali
present in the plating solution.

A light vat should be supported on short stout
trestles, at a height suitable to the workmen--that
is, with the upper rim about the same height as
an ordinary table. Two, three, or four such

[Page.]

supports will be required, according to the length
of the vat. If, however, the vat is large and
heavy, it should be supported by a strong foundation
of masonry, and this should be so built as to
ensure free access of air to the under side, thus
preventing rot in the wood. If the floor round
the vat can be coated with cement or asphalt it
can be easily kept clean, and it is also advisable
to have wooden grids on the floor by the sides of
the vat, on which the workmen may stand.

Special iron stands for vats can be obtained
(see Fig. 4); these are provided with means of
heating the vat by gas.

It is possible to make a small electro-plating
bath with glass plates cemented together and
enclosed in a wooden box. The cement may be
either marine glue, which can be bought, or 2 parts
of pitch and 1 part of gutta percha can be melted
together. Pour some of the melted material into
the wooden box and spread in a thin layer over
the bottom with a warm iron; while the cement
is warm (not hot) press the bottom plate firmly
into it. The sides may be treated in the same
way, but before putting in the glass plates warm
them gently and coat all the edges with a thin
layer of the cement, so that when they are pressed
together the surfaces will adhere thoroughly; the
joints will then be waterproof. Make the wood
box a trifle large, allowing room for the layer
of cement, or if the glass plates be forced in and
nothing allowed for contraction and expansion the
glass box will probably crack at the weakest part.
Another suitable cement is prepared as follows:
Make some good flour paste, and allow to get cold.
Prepare a quantity of thin glue, add 10 gr. of
powdered bichromate of potash to each gill of
glue, bring it to a boiling temperature, and then
pour it into the cold paste whilst stirring. Use
this cement warm, and expose to strong sunlight
afterwards. It will resist acids, but not hot

[Page.]

cyanide of potassium solutions. Still another
cement is made by dissolving best isinglass in
acetic acid by the aid of heat; it is used hot.

The electrical fittings of the plating vat are
described in the next chapter.

The articles to be plated are suspended in the
plating solution from copper rods (see p. 51)
by means of short lengths of wire, named slinging
wires. These are made of bare copper wires,
ranging in gauge from No. 8 to No. 18, the larger

[Fig. 4.--Iron Stand for Vat.]

[Fig. 5.--Copper Hook.]

size being employed for heavy, and the smaller
sizes for light, articles. Two wires of No. 18 will
hold up a cycle handle-bar; but it is always
advisable to have more wires or larger wires than
required merely to support the articles, since these
wires convey the electric current from the goods
being plated; and an insufficient wire conductor
here will prevent the nickel from going on as fast
or as well as may be required. Small wires offer
a greater resistance to the current, and should be
avoided for this reason.

The connection between the slinging wires and
the articles to be plated is by means of copper

[Page.]

hooks, the usual pattern of which is shown by
Fig. 5.

The plated articles are rinsed in hot water
after leaving the plating vat, and are then
transferred at once to hot boxwood sawdust, in which
they are dried quickly. This treatment is needed
to prevent the coat of deposited metal from being
marked by stains. The sawdust is held in a
shallow pan or tank of iron placed next the hot
water tank. This pan is heated by hot water or
steam. If hot water is used, it occupies the double
bottom, this being heated by steam jets; by
the other method, the steam passes through a
coiled pipe in the double bottom (see Fig. 6).
Direct heat from a fire or from gas jets is
inadmissible, because this would char the sawdust,
and thus stain the work. If live high-pressure
steam is employed, this should be used in a coil
of pipes not directly in contact with the sawdust
(see Fig. 6), as such very hot steam is liable to
char the sawdust. Boxwood sawdust is employed,
because this does not contain resinous matter,
likely to be extracted by heat, and stain the
metal; but the sawdust of sycamore could be used
as a substitute if more readily obtainable. The
sawdust tank and the hot-water tank may be of
galvanised iron, if this is of any advantage.

The Bunsen burner will frequently be useful.
It is composed of a short burner inside a piece
of gas barrel some five or six inches in length,
to which air is admitted at the lower end.
The air mixes with the incoming gas in the
barrel, and the mixture burns together at the
top with an intensely hot, smokeless, and
non-luminous flame. When the tube of the burner
is surmounted with a cap, the flame spurts out of
the holes, and forms a "rose burner," the flame
from which can be used for general heating
purposes.

The balances or scales required by an electro-

[Page.]

plater will vary with the class of work on which
he is engaged. For the ordinary work of weighing
the goods before and after plating, to determine
how much metal has been deposited, a pair
of scales with a stout steel or brass beam will
be required. For weighing gold and gilded
articles a lighter pair, indicating a turn on one
grain at least, should be provided; these will also
serve for weighing out the ingredients used in
making up solutions. For rough assays and
estimations a small cheap balance indicating a turn

[Fig. 6.--Steam-heated Sawdust Pan.]

of 1/10 grain will serve the purpose; the cost of
this, together with weights from 500 grs. down
to 1/10 grain, will be about £l 10s. For assays,
analysis, and calibrations, a still more elaborate
and delicate balance will be required, such as an
Oertling assay balance fitted with agate bearings
and indicating a turn with at least 1/100th of a
grain. Such a balance, with a full set of weights,
will cost from £5 to £10.

In some plating establishments the weight of
deposited metal is determined during the operation
of plating by means of a plating balance.
This is merely a pair of large scales furnished
with a scale pan at one end of the beam and a

[Page.]

metal frame suspended over the bath at the other
end. The goods to be plated are slung to the
metal frame, and the whole is balanced by weights
placed in the scale pan. The pillar of the beam
is connected to the negative pole of the machine
or battery. As the metal goes on the goods to

[Fig. 7.--Roseleur's Plating-Balance.]

be plated, the beam is thrown out of balance,
and the exact weight deposited can be ascertained
at any time by additional weights placed
in the scale pan.

Roseleur's plating balance is shown by Fig. 7.
The beam carries at one end a metal ring R, from
which the objects to be plated are suspended in

[Page.]

the bath B. The anode a is shown as a rod connected
through terminals, etc., to the positive pole
of the battery. From the opposite end of the
balance the pan S is hung. A metal pin m dips
into the mercury cup n, and this cup is connected
to the negative pole of the battery. The path of
the current is therefore from the battery by way
of the anode a through the bath, and thence, by
way of the articles to be plated, through the beam
and mercury contact back to the battery. In the
horizontal position of the beam, m does not make
contact with n. But the weight of the articles is
balanced by adding weights to the pan S, and
further weights are then added equal to the
weight of silver to be deposited. This brings m
down and completes the circuit. When the required
weight of metal has been deposited, the
left arm of the beam (as seen in Fig. 15) rises
and breaks the circuit. It will be seen that the
balance is automatic, cutting off the current when
the articles are plated to the extent intended.

The work of the plating balance is done in a
different way by a special ammeter (p. 54) which
records the amount of silver deposited per hour.

Beakers are tumblers made of very thin
Bohemian glass for special use in chemical
manipulations where small quantities of acids and
other liquids are employed at high temperatures.
Tumblers made of ordinary glass would soon
break in pieces, but these thin glass beakers will
bear boiling water being poured into them, or
will hold acid whilst it is being boiled in them
over a gas stove. They are also useful in analysis
of solutions, as the clear glass enables the
operation of precipitation to be observed whilst the
operator holds the beaker away from his face, and
thus avoids breathing the deleterious fumes.

CHAPTER II.

BATTERIES, DYNAMOS, AND ELECTRICAL ACCESSORIES.

The electric current used to deposit metal from
plating solutions must be obtained from a convenient
source; this may be a battery for occasional
jobs, and for the general use of the amateur
or small professional; and it may be a dynamo
when large quantities of work have to be treated.
The advantages of the dynamo are many. The
current is more constant, labour is lessened, and
the cost of maintenance is much reduced. The
current can also be regulated, and thus any class
of work can be done from one machine. A plating
dynamo gives a large current at a low pressure;
the armature may be of the drum or ring pattern,
and the machine is shunt wound. With a large
machine, capable of giving, say, 200 amperes,
large surfaces of work may be acted on in several
vats simultaneously, and nickel-plating may
proceed at the same time as silver-plating.

The electro-motive force required to be supplied
by the battery or dynamo varies according
to the bath. Thus, for gold and silver, it may be
from 1/2 to 4 volts; for copper, with an acid bath,
it may be from 1/2 to 1-1/2 volts, or, with a cyanide
bath, from 3 to 6 volts. The amperage will vary
with the area of the anode and cathode surfaces.

The word battery, as applied to electrical
apparatus, belongs strictly to a collection of Leyden
jars charged with static electricity. These
discharge their store of force in a violent manner,
totally unlike the equable flow of current obtained
from collections of voltaic or galvanic cells.

French electricians speak and write of such
generators under the name of "Piles" doubtless
in deference to the form of the first voltaic
generator of electricity made--the pile of metal
discs invented by Volta. English electricians
apply the word battery to all apparatus in which
electricity is generated by chemical decomposition,
and also to two forms of storage cells known
respectively as accumulators and Leyden jars.

A tabulated list of the batteries in use by
electro-platers is given on p. 25, and the table
will show at a glance the battery most suitable for
any particular work.

Other batteries, such as the Fuller, Wollaston,
Gassner, and very occasionally the Leclanche, are
also used by some platers; these will be referred
to later.

The Daniell is best for depositing copper from
its sulphate solution and silver from the usual
plating solution, but the Bunsen may be used for
this purpose if the exciting liquid is sufficiently
weakened. One or two large cells in series will
be enough for all ordinary purposes. The Bunsen
is best for depositing copper and brass from their
alkaline solutions, and also for the deposition of
nickel, because its electro-motive force is high,
enabling the current to push through high resistances.
It is not suitable for the work of silver-plating,
gilding, and electrotyping, because its high
E.M.F. causes the metal to go on too fast and in a
granular condition. In all these operations the
Daniell will be found to be the best because its
E.M.F. is lower than that of the Bunsen, and its
current equally constant in volume. The Smee,
and also Walker, are eminently useful cells
for giving a current suitable to the work of
electro-gilding small articles of jewellery. Batteries
with a high E.M.F. cause gold to go on too fast, and
give the deposit a brown colour.

[Page.]

Some information as to the form and construction
of the various batteries used by electro-platers
may now be given.

The Daniell cell is known in several modifications,
Fig. 8 showing the internal arrangement
of the porous pot form. The glass or glazed
vitrified stoneware jar J contains the cylindrical
plate C (made of sheet copper), the porous pot P
(made of unglazed earthenware), and the zinc

[Fig. 8.--Daniell Cell.]
 
[Fig. 9.--Bunsen Battery.]

rod Z. Inside the porous pot dilute sulphuric
acid is poured, while the copper plate C stands in
a saturated solution of copper sulphate. The
connections are made to the two wires shown in
the illustration. The maximum electromotive
force of the cell is about 1.14 volts, with an
internal resistance of 3 ohms in the 3-pint size,
and 1.6 ohms in the 3-quart size.

A Daniell battery is re-charged in the following
way: Thoroughly clean all the parts and reamal-

[Page.]

gamate the zincs; charge the porous pot, containing
the zinc, with a solution of 1 part of sulphuric
acid in 12 or 13 parts of water, and the outer
jar, containing the copper plate, with a saturated
solution of sulphate of copper. The small sieve
or tray near the top of the containing jar, but
below the level of the copper solution, should
contain crystals of sulphate of copper to keep the
solution saturated. If copper is allowed to deposit
on the porous pot, the current will fail, not
only on account of a higher internal resistance,
but also because this short-circuits the cells. To
prevent this, the zinc and also the zinc sediment
must be kept from touching the porous partitions.

The Daniell battery is very constant. Whilst
the sulphate of copper solution is kept saturated,
and the zinc kept in working order (well amalgamated--
coated with mercury), the current will not
flag at all during the day; it is therefore most
suitable for silver-plating and gilding, but it is
very troublesome to keep in working order, unless
kept well at work and employed every day.

The Bunsen battery as used in England is
made up of an outer containing cell of stoneware,
containing a cylinder of amalgamated zinc, inside
which is a cell of porous earthenware containing
a square bar of carbon (see Fig. 9). The outer
cell is charged with sulphuric acid diluted with
water, and the inner cell is charged with strong
commercial nitric acid. The electro-motive force
given by this cell is variously stated by authorities
as 1.85 to 1.95 volts. The internal resistance of
the cells varies with their size, the condition of
the porous cell, and the condition of the acid
charges; the resistance being variously given as
0.30, 0.08, and 0.06 ohms. These probably represent
respectively the pint, quart, and half-gallon
sizes of cells used by the persons testing them.
The E.M.F. of the quart Bunsen when charged
with sulphuric acid diluted with twelve parts of

[Page.]

water in the outer cell, and strong nitric acid in
the inner cell, may be put down at 1.86 volts, and
its internal resistance at 0.08 ohm. This will give
a current of about 23 amperes on a short circuit,
or 1.78 amperes through an external resistance of
1 ohm. As gold is deposited from its solutions at
the rate of 37.31 grains per ampere hour, this
current will deposit 64.17 grains per hour. It will
also deposit 105.50 grains of silver in the same
time. As, however, silver is best deposited with
a low E.M.F. of from 1.5 to 1.6 volts, and gold
with an E.M.F. of 1.2 volts, the Bunsen has a
tendency to deposit both of these metals in a rough
condition, unsuited to work that must be burnished.

The Bunsen cell is well suited to gilding and
silvering small articles, such as chains and trinkets
slung to fine wires offering a high resistance;
but, for plating spoons and forks, and for plating
on large surfaces, the current from a large
Daniell, Smee, or Wollaston is preferable, because
it deposits a coat more adapted to the action of
the burnisher. The Bunsen cell, however, has
become a favourite with trinket platers, because
it is easy to set up and cleanly in working, thus
causing very little labour in setting up and putting
away.

A Bunsen battery may be made as follows:
Obtain a stoneware jar of quart size or larger, and
in it place a cylinder of zinc about 1/8 in. thick;
inside this zinc cylinder place a porous pot about
1/2 in. smaller in diameter but 2 in. higher than
the stone cell, and inside the porous pot put a
rectangular stick of carbon, say 2 in. by 1/4 in.
by 10 in. to 12 in. long. The zinc cylinder must
be well amalgamated with mercury, being dipped
in a dilute solution of oil of vitriol to clean, and
then placed in a shallow porcelain tray (such as
photographers use) in which is a quantity of
hydrochloric acid and mercury. On rubbing the

[Page.]

mercury over it the zinc will be coated inside
and out. Allow the zincs to stand on end for a
time to drain the excess mercury off. Fix the
zincs and carbons w4th brass connections, and
join the batteries in series--that is, connect the
zinc of one cell to the carbon of the next, leaving
a free end of the zinc and of the carbon. The
batteries must be charged with acid as follows.
Run the nitric acid inside the porous cell till about
three-quarters full, and fill the space between the
porous cell and the stoneware with a mixture of
1 part of sulphuric acid to 9 parts of water.

The French Bunsen is made up with sulphuric
acid in the porous cell with the carbon, thus
producing a constant generator with a lower E.M.F.
The current from the French Bunsen has an E.M.F.
of 1.8 volts at starting, but it soon falls to 1.6
or 1.5 volts when the circuit is closed, because the
sulphuric acid is inferior to nitric acid as a
depolariser. This form is also less troublesome to
keep in working order than the ordinary Bunsen,
and it is free from noxious fumes, which render
the presence of the ordinary Bunsen well-nigh
intolerable in close workshops.

Nearly all the batteries given in the list on
p. 25 may be modified. A modification of the
Bunsen has just been noticed. In the table,
mention is made of the various strengths of acid
solutions to be used in the zinc compartments
of the batteries. These suggest other important
modifications, the E.M.F. of the battery varying
with the quantity of acid used. For instance, the
E.M.F. of the Bunsen charged with a solution of
one part sulphuric acid and eight parts of water
may give an E.M.F. of 1.95 volts, but when charged
with a solution of 1 part sulphuric acid to 10 or
12 parts of water the E.M.F. may fall to even less
than 1.80 volts. The Daniell, Smee, and Walker
may be modified in like manner.

The Wollaston battery takes the form shown

[Page.]

by Fig. 10. All the couples of copper and zinc plates
are contained in separate cells a d of glass
or porcelain, which hold the sulphuric acid or
other exciting fluid. The zinc plates are each kept
adjusted centrally by wooden slips between the
halves of a doubled copper plate bent round under
them. The whole set of plates is connected by
copper strips m, and is secured to the wooden
frame K; so it can at pleasure be lifted out of
the fluid and the action of the battery stopped.

[Fig. 10.--Wollaston Battery.]

This is one of the earliest galvanic batteries
introduced after Volta's original invention.

The Wollaston battery is the least costly and
least troublesome of all the plater's galvanic
batteries, but it is also most inconstant, as its
current is apt to fall off rapidly after being set to
work; but it recovers its strength after a few
minutes' rest, and it is a handy battery for such
short jobs as generally fall to the lot of the
country jeweller. One form of it may be made at
home as follows: Get three or four open-mouthed
jars of glass, stoneware, or porcelain, of any size

[Page.]

from one quart to one gallon, the larger size being
preferable; these are to serve as battery cells.
Next get some three or four plates of rolled zinc,
just large enough and long enough to go in the
jars; clean the plates well in hot water containing
washing soda, and rinse them in clean water.
Pour some water in an earthenware baking-dish,
about enough to cover a zinc plate; then pour in
carefully some sulphuric acid, 1 part for every
10 parts of water in the dish. In this mixture
immerse the zinc plates, one at a time, and pour
on each a small quantity of mercury; spread this
over both sides of each plate with a mop made
of tow containing a few brass wires, and then
coat them perfectly. This is termed "amalgamating"
the zincs. The acid mixture may be used
with some more to work the battery, and the
excess mercury can be used over again. These
zinc plates have to be suspended to a cross-head
of wood (each plate between two plates of copper
in each cell). The wood supports should be cut
out of hard wood to the shape shown in Fig. 11,
so as to enclose each zinc plate between two
pieces of wood, the plates fitting in the recesses
cut for them. The wood should now be well
varnished, or, better still, well soaked in melted
paraffin wax. Each zinc plate can then be
enclosed between two wooden supports, these
secured to each other by long brass screws passing
through both, and the plate held up by a binding
screw on the top, as shown in Fig. 12. A pair of
copper plates must now be obtained for each zinc
plate, the copper being slightly larger than the
zinc, and of any thickness. They work all the
better if they are cross-scored with a file, or if
they have a rough coat of electrotype copper
deposited on them; they work better still if they
are coated with platinum, but this necessitates
the use of a battery and a costly platinum
solution. The copper plates may be secured to the

[Page.]

cross-heads on each side of the zincs by very
short brass screws, care being taken not to let
any of them touch the zinc plates; or they may
be clamped with brass clamps (Fig. 12) sold for

[Fig. 11.--Part of Battery Plate Support.]

[Fig. 12.--Battery Plates Mounted for Use.]

the purpose. When clamps are used, it is always
quite easy to remove the plates for cleaning, and
to reverse the zinc plates so as to wear both ends
equally. The battery jars are charged with an
acid mixture, made by pouring one part by volume

[Page.]

of sulphuric acid into twelve parts of water, and
allowing it to cool before using. The plates are
suspended by the wooden cross-heads in this mixture.
When it is wished to increase the pushing-force
(the E.M.F.) of the current, the copper plates
of one cell are connected by a length of No. 16
copper wire to the zinc plate of the next cell,
and so on through the whole series of cells, taking
in as many as may be wanted. When a low-tension

[Fig. 13.--Smee Cell.]

current of large
volume is desired, all the
copper plates of the cells
are connected together by
one set of wires, and all
the zinc plates by another
set of wires. The cells
may be placed in a wooden
tray or in a shallow box,
and all the cross-heads may
be secured to a long bar
of wood, which may be
suspended to a support
above, or to an arrangement
for lifting all the
plates out of the cells
when the battery is not
wanted. This arrangement
will also be found to be
most convenient for
controlling the current, as its volume can be
lessened at any time by exposing a less
surface of the plates to the action of
the battery acid. When the battery is not required
for use, the plates should be lifted out of
the cells, and if they are not likely to be wanted
for a few days, they should be well rinsed in an
abundance of water, to free them from acid. It
will be necessary to take out the zinc plates
occasionally, clean them, and freshly amalgamate their
surfaces. This must be done at any time if the

[Page.]

plates give off a liissing noise, and appear to be
blackened by the acid.

The Smee cell is constructed on the principle
shown in Fig. 13. In a rectangular glass vessel
are two zinc plates Zn, held together by a screw,
and between them, well insulated, is a platinum
plate or a silver plate covered with platinum
(see Ag.). The vessel is filled with diluted H2SO4,
and is made larger than the plates so that the

[Fig. 14.--Battery of Smee Cells.]

zinc sulphate which is forming may not come into
contact with the plates, and may fall to the
bottom of the vessel. A battery of Smee cells is
shown by Fig. 14. In this figure, Z and P
respectively indicate the zinc and platinum and their
connections. It is possible to make up the Smee in
a similar manner to that described for the Wollaston,
except that platinised silver foil, soldered to
copper frames, is used instead of copper plates
for the negative elements, but in all other respects
the battery may be made like the Wollaston, and

[Page.]

will give similar results, but its action is longer
sustained after being connected to the work,
because it does not polarise so soon. The proper
exciting liquid is a mixture of one part by measure
of sulphuric acid and seven of water, which will
be found strong enough for all purposes.
Frequently it is advisable to use only one part of
acid to ten or sixteen parts of water, and to add
acid as required, taking care, however, that the
quantity of acid never exceeds one-fourth of the
original water, for any excess above that quantity
will be useless, as the liquid will then become
saturated with the sulphate of zinc. Still further
modifications may be made in the battery by
enlarging or diminishing the size of the negative or
the positive element, or both of these, and in
altering the size of cell containing them. As a
rule, the enlargement of elements and cells tends
to an increased output of current, because the
internal resistance of the battery is lowered, and
there is, consequently, more available force for
the outer circuit. Enlarging the negative element
will frequently bring about the desired result of
lowering the internal resistance of the battery
and increasing its volume of current. This is
specially noticed in the Daniell, Smee, and Walker
batteries.

The Fuller cell (Fig. 15) has an outside stoneware
jar with an inner porous pot, the outer jar
having a plate of carbon in chromic acid or
bichromate of potash solution, with one-quarter of
its bulk of sulphuric acid. In the illustration a
part of the porous pot is cut away the better to
show the zinc. The inner porous pot contains a
rod of zinc ending in a plug Z, the bottom of the
pot is covered with mercury, the remainder of the
cell being filled with sulphuric acid and water.
The electromotive force is 1.50 volts.

One of two charges can be used for a Fuller
cell. In one the porous pot with the zinc plug is

[Page.]

charged with a solution of 1 oz. of common salt
to 1 pint of water. In the other a solution of
12 parts of water to 1 part of sulphuric acid is
used. In using either of these solutions, about
1 oz. of mercury should be placed at the bottom
of the porous pot, to ensure constant amalgamation
of the zinc, thereby preventing waste. The
outer jar, containing the carbon plate, is charged
with a solution made by dissolving bichromate of
potash 3 oz. to every pint of warm water, and

[Fig 15.--Fuller Cell.]

then adding 3 oz. of sulphuric
acid gradually, stirring with
a stick. The addition of the
acid causes the solution to
become scalding hot, so care
should be taken to make the
mixture in a vessel that will
not crack. All the solutions
should be quite cold when the
cell is put up for use. The
size of the porous pot depends
on the shape and size of the
outer one. It should stand
up about 1 in. above the
outer pot, and should
comfortably hold the zinc plug
without occupying too much room in the outer jar.

When a battery is wanted for use for only a
few minutes at a time, or merely to flash on a
thin coat of silver to hide defects or discoloured
patches, the Gassner dry battery may be used.
This battery needs no attention in the way of
setting up or cleaning, as it is always ready for
work, and will furnish current sufficient to gild
a brooch, scarf pin, or even a bracelet, or to plate
such an article with a thin coat of silver. The
large double-carbon square cells should be
selected for this purpose, and the battery should be
made up of two of these cells in series. They will
last about two years, without renewal, on such

[Page.]

intermittent work as has just been mentioned.
If used for jobs which will necessitate a constant
supply of current for more than ten minutes, the
battery will soon be exhausted.

The Gassner cell (Fig. 16), one of the earliest
of dry batteries, is complete in itself, instead of
being a composite cell made up of inner and outer
vessels. There is no porous cell of any kind, or
any outer cell of glass, porcelain, or other
breakable material. The battery case is of thin sheet
zinc, which may be made in any form and of any
size required. The sheet zinc case, which forms
the positive element, is nearly filled with a paste
composed of zinc oxide and gypsum, moistened
with a solution of zinc chloride. A capped cube
of carbon, bearing a binding screw on its head,
forms the negative element in the centre of the
case, where it is surrounded by the conducting
and exciting paste. The whole is sealed over with
a composition resembling marine glue. It will
thus be seen that there is no liquid to spill, nor
is any required, as the paste is moist enough to
excite the zinc, and it will retain its moist
condition for any length of time. The cells may
therefore be laid on their sides, or turned upside
down, without impairing their working qualities.
They may be placed in any convenient position,
regardless of the temperature of the room in
which they are located. When a Gassner cell is
exhausted, a strong current of electricity (such
as that from a battery of Bunsen cells) is sent
through the cell from carbon to zinc for about
an hour to regenerate its contents, but the effect is
only temporary. Other dry cells have equal value.

The square form of the Gassner cell here
recommended is divided by a zinc partition into two
equal parts, each containing a block of carbon.
This increases the exposed surfaces of the two
elements, and ensures a corresponding low
internal resistance to the cell. There is also a

[Page.]

small cell made, and this is furnished with a
hollow cube of carbon. The tall oblong form is
enclosed in a case of vitrified iron, which gives
additional strength and adds to its appearance.
Each carbon is furnished with a terminal binding
screw, as in the Leclanche battery, but a piece of
stout copper wire is soldered to the zinc case for

[Fig. l6. --Gassner Dry Cell.]

[Fig. 17.--Leclanche Cell.]

connecting purposes. The top of each cell is
sealed with a resinous composition.

The Leclanche cell is not suitable for regular
plating; but if an occasional plater happens to
possess one he can use it for small jobs requiring
current for a few minutes only. The Leclanche
cell always has a glass outer containing jar which
is of square shape, for convenience of packing to
form a battery (see Fig. 17), with a large round

[Page.]

mouth furnished with a lip. The cell complete
has the top of the mouth, both inside and out,
for about an inch down, coated with Brunswick
black, paraffin wax, or similar material, that will
prevent the salts formed by the contents from
creeping over the edge. This coating is applied
by thoroughly cleaning the jar, heating it, and
either dipping the rim into melted paraffin wax,
or giving it two or three coats of Brunswick black.
The porous pot which goes inside the glass jar
contains a carbon plate with a lead cap, on which
is a binding-screw with connections. The whole
of the space between the carbon and the pot, to
within 1/2 in. of the top, is filled up with a mixture
of equal parts by bulk of crushed coke or carbon
and peroxide of manganese, crushed to the size
of very small peas or rice grains, sifted from the
dust and packed in as tightly as possible. So as
to allow the gas formed in working to escape,
two little pieces of glass tube are embedded in
the mixture on each side of the carbon, and then
the top should be sealed up with melted pitch,
or pitch and resin mixed; the top of one tube is
shown in Fig. 17. The whole of the top should
have two or three coats of Brunswick black,
working well over the lead cap and into the top
of the carbon plate, and down the outside of the top
of the pot for about 1 in.; dip the bottom
of the porous pot for about 1/4 in. into melted
paraffin wax, and the negative element is ready
for use. The positive element is generally a rod
of drawn zinc; if cast it is crystalline and brittle.
A hole should be drilled in the top, and a stout
piece of gutta-percha covered copper wire either
screwed or soldered in. The joint should be well
covered with gutta-percha or several coats of
Brunswick black. The zinc should be amalgamated
by the following method. With a file remove
rough excrescences, etc., and have ready
two glass jars deep enough to take the zincs;

[Page.]

one of these should be half full of water containing
about a tea-spoonful of sulphuric acid, the
other a quarter full of the same mixture with a
little mercury at the bottom. Dip the rod first in
the tube with the acid and water to clean it well,
then into the one with the mercury, and by holding
it in a slanting position the mercury can be
easily flowed all over the zinc by twisting it round.
Wipe off the superfluous mercury with a rag, and
the rod is ready for use.

A Leclanche cell is charged by three-parts
filling the outer jar with a strong solution of
ordinary sal-ammoniac; if the jar is more than
three-parts filled, the salts of the solution will
creep up. In a few hours the cell will be ready
for use. Should it not be convenient to wait,
pour through the little glass tubes in the seal
some of the solution into the porous pot, and the
cell will be in working order in a minute or so.
The chemical action that goes on during the
working of the cell is this: The zinc, sal-ammoniac,
and peroxide of manganese are changed into zinc
chloride, water, and ammonia; and the oxide of
manganese is reduced to an oxide less rich in
oxygen. Using chemical signs, Zn, 2NH4Cl, and
2MnO2, become ZnCl3, H2O + 2NH3, and Mn2O3.

Where a good, full current is wanted for short
periods at intervals--such as for electric-bell work
--a cell of this type is suitable; it is of no use
where continuous currents are needed--as in
electro-plating--as it polarises quickly, recovering
itself, however, equally rapidly. It has
another advantage^action does not go on inside
the cell unless the circuit is closed and the cell is
doing work; therefore it can stand for months
always ready charged without any fear of the
zincs being eaten away; moreover, it is not
affected by changes of temperature, and it does
not give off noxious fumes. The E.M.F. of the
Leclanche cell is 1.60 volts, and the internal re-

[Page.]

sistance varies between .75 and .85 ohm in the
3-pint size; 1.l and 1.2 in the quart size; and 1.5
and 1.6 in the pint size.

With regard to wet batteries in general, cells
holding from 1 to 10 gallons each, and elements
of a corresponding size, become a necessity when
large articles have to be plated, or when a great
number of articles has to be plated at the same
time. This necessity may be partly met by employing
a great number of small cells coupled in
multiple arc, but small cells thus coupled up soon
run down, because, being placed on short circuit,
their charges of acid are soon used up. The best
work is generally obtained when the elements of
the battery present a slightly larger surface to
the liquids within the battery than that of the
anodes to the solution in the vat.

Lastly, the current obtainable from a battery
may be modified by the manner in which the cells
are coupled together. If the E.M.F is too low,
the cells may be coupled up in series until the
required E.M.F. has been obtained; or, on the
other hand, if the E.M.F. is too high, it may be
reduced by taking off some of the cells. It is not
good practice to couple two or more cells of a
different style of battery together to obtain the
needed E.M.F., as the weak cells always pull down
the current to their own level, and the current from
the stronger cells will heat the solutions in the
weakest, thus impairing the efiiciency of the
battery.

Batteries for electro-deposition are fast giving
place to dynamos, which yield a current in every
respect more suitable to the work of depositing
metals th'an that from the best batteries. They
are also more cleanly in working, less costly, and
more easily managed.

Success in electro-plating largely depends upon
the choice of a suitable dynamo. Dynamos designed
for electro-plating differ considerably from

[Page.]

those employed in electric lighting work. For
electro-plating is required a machine capable of
giving a large volume of current at a low pressure,
and this must be delivered continuously in one
direction. Machines for electric lighting work
are designed to give only a moderate volume of
current at a high pressure, and this may be of an
alternating character--that is, a kind of see-saw,
or to-and-fro movement.

The difference in the two classes of machines
may be clearly shown by noting in figures the
relative value of their output. The output of
dynamos for plating runs from 30 to 300 amperes,
at pressures varying from 5 to 8 volts, whilst the
continuous current dynamos used in electric
lighting are designed for outputs varying from 3 to
300 amperes, at pressures of from 30 to several
hundred volts. As 8 volts is the maximum pressure
needed to deposit metals from their solutions, a
dynamo giving a current having a pressure of 30
volts is manifestly unsuitable.

Another characteristic of the plating dynamo
is seen in the winding and connection of its coils.
An electric-lighting machine may have its coils
connected in series, but an electro-plating machine
must have the coils so wound as to be shunt
connected, or some special means must be devised to
prevent the back current from the plating vat
going through the coils and reversing the
magnetism of the machine. Electro-plating machines
are also run at a slower speed than machines for
electric lighting. The would-be plater should,
therefore, avoid all offers of cheap machines that
have been used in electric lighting.

It is not necessary to specify any particular
type of dynamo as being the best, since all makers
of dynamos are prepared to design and make
plating dynamos from various types of castings.
Their value does not depend so much on their
form as on the perfection of their construction

[Page.]

and fitting from an engineer's point of view, and
the proper proportion and winding of their coils.
Firms supplying plating requisites are usually
prepared to furnish suitable dynamos, and these
may be generally relied upon as being the best
for the purpose.

Some idea as to the general form of a useful
electro-plating dynamo may be gleaned from Fig.
18, which shows a dynamo made by Messrs. J. E.
Hartley and Son. It has a heavy bed-plate of
iron, on which are two vertical massive iron
projections wound with covered copper wire.
Between these projections, near the top, in a channel
or tunnel hollowed out in the two horns of iron,
is an axle or cylinder of iron also wound with
coils of wire, with their ends fastened to a ring
or wheel of metal divided into segments. This
cylinder is called the armature, and the ring is
the commutator, whilst the two vertical
projections are the field-magnets. When the armature
is revolved in the tunnel between these field-magnets,
its coils cut through lines of magnetic
force, which stream across the tunnel, and this
action sets up an electric current in the armature
coils. The current is conveyed from these to the
segments of the commutator, and is picked up
from them by metal pads called brushes, which
rest on the segments. From the brushes, part of
the current goes around the field-magnet coils to
strengthen them, and the remainder is available
for the work of depositing metal. The brushes
are fixed to a rocker, insulated from the rest of
the machine, and wire cables lead from this to
stout binding screws or clamps on a board fixed
to the top of the field-magnets. Stout wire cables
convey the electric current from the binding
screws to other screws fixed on rods placed across
the tops of the plating vats--that is, the vessels
holding the plating solutions. From one of these
rods a number of nickel plates are suspended in

[Page.]

the solution; from the opposite rod the goods to
be plated are suspended by metal hooks in the
solution, and when this is done the electric circuit
is completed.

The route taken by the current is from the
positive or outgoing pole of the dynamo, along
one of the wire cables to the rod holding the
anodes, down these into the solution, through the

[Fig. 18.--Electro-plater's Dynamo.]

solution to the articles being plated, then back to
the dynamo by the other cable attached to the
negative or incoming pole of the machine. This
route has been explained so that readers may get
an intelligent insight into the arrangement of
dynamo and vats, in order that no mistake may be
made in fixing the machine (see also p. 55).

A useful dynamo for working small quantities

[Page.]

of plating solutions may be made as follows by
anyone acquainted with the mechanism of
dynamo-electric machinery. Procure castings for
a Kapp or over-type form of field, with cores 8 in.
in height, 6 in. in length, and 1 in. in thickness,
and a laininated drum or shuttle armature 3 in. in
diameter and 6 in. long. A shuttle armature is
easier to wind, but more current can be got from
a drum armature. If a shuttle armature is chosen,
wind it with 1-1/2 lb. of No. 16 cotton-covered
copper wire, and the fields with 6 lb. of No. 18
cotton-covered wire, connected in shunt with the
armature. If a drum armature is chosen, wind it
with 2 lb. of No. 16 cotton-covered wire, and the
fields with 6 lb. of No. 18 cotton-covered wire,
connected in shunt. The speed may be low--say, from
900 to 1,200 revolutions per minute. Copper and
nickel will require the higher speed. Any
steady-running motor will drive the machine, which will
only absorb about 1 man power.

Canning's shunt-wound semi-enclosed plating
dynamo with slotted drum armature is shown by
Fig. 19. Its entire frame, which is also the
magnet yoke, is of cast iron of high permeability, and
is in one piece. The shaft is of mild steel of
ample strength, and has a keyway for all fixed
parts. The bearings are bolted to the frame, and
are lubricated automatically by revolving rings
running in oil wells. The solid gun-metal bushes
are easy of access for inspection, and are
provided with the necessary holes for drawing off
the oil when it requires renewing. The magnet
windings have a high electrical efficiency and are
of cotton-covered copper wire wound on formers,
built up with ends securely bound with tape,
thoroughly insulated and coupled to terminals by
lead eyes soldered to ends of wires. Fringe rings
are used in all machines above 50 amperes, and
are easily removed and arranged to keep windings
in place. The armature core is of the slotted

[Page.]

drum type, composed of sheet-iron plates well
insulated, clamped between two cast-iron plates
and securely fixed to the shaft. The armature is
wound with covered wire, thoroughly insulated

[Fig. 19.--Semi-enclosed Plating Dynamo.]

and firmly embedded in the slots of the discs,
and held by wire bands which are insulated with
mica from any portion of the armature. The
armature can be easily taken out by removing the

[Page.]

bearing at the pulley end, and is accurately
balanced. The commutators have a deep wearing
surface, and are made with copper segments
insulated from each other with mica. The brush
holders and rockers to carry them are fitted with
adjustable springs and hold-off catches, and are
connected directly to a bush or by a flexible
stranded cable. The rockers are adjustable and
fitted with clamping screws enabling them to be
set in any position. The brushes are of copper
wire encased in gauze. The terminals are placed
in a convenient position on the dynamo frame,
and are tinned ready for the copper conductor to
be soldered in. The driving pulley is of cast iron,
rounded on the face, and is securely keyed to the
shaft. The dynamo will stand an overload of 25
per cent, for one hour without undue heating or
sparking, and a greater overload for short periods.

Having received a dynamo from the maker, its
position in the workshop should be determined.
It is not necessary to have it close to the plating
vat, as the plater can easily look after the machine
if it is at one end of the shop and the plating vat
at the other. It should not be fixed in another
apartment out of sight, or in any position where
it is likely to pick up metal dust and other dirt.
When it is revolving, a current of air sets in
towards the armature, and draws with it any
dust that may be flying about the shop. As it is
a strong magnet, it will attract to itself any small
particles of iron, steel, nickel, or cobalt, such as
filings of those metals. It is therefore advisable
to bolt it down firmly on a strong bench raised
above the floor. As the machine is driven at a
high rate of speed, and this sets up a strong
vibration of its parts, the bench must be strong
and firm to lessen as much as possible the
vibration.

The dynamo should be driven from a counter-shaft
furnished with fast and loose pulleys driven at

[Page.]

a lively speed, to obviate the necessity of driving
with a tight belt on a large driving wheel. It is also
best not to have the driving wheel of the counter-shaft
directly over the dynamo. The machine works
best when driven with a wide, long belt, as this
ensures a better grip of the pulley on the
armature spindle. Most makers advise the speed at
which the machine should be driven, and this may
be ascertained by means of a little speed indicator.
The direction in which the dynamo armature
should revolve is indicated by the position of the
brushes; it must never be run against them.

Having fixed the machine and started the
machinery to work it, an attempt must be made
to start the dynamo so as to get the best results
from it. See that when turned by hand all its
parts move freely without a hitch; see also that
the oil cups are provided with oil. Now start the
machine and connect it by means of two thick wires
to an ammeter--that is, an instrument for
measuring the volume of the current. This is a
most important instrument, and, if not provided
in the outfit in connection with a resistance board,
it should be purchased afterwards, as it is to the
plater what the foot-rule is to the mechanic.
When connected to the ammeter, note the deflection
of the needle or hand of this instrument, then
alter the position of the brushes until the best
effect has been obtained--that is, the largest
number of amperes indicated on the dial. This
alteration may be effected by loosening the screw which
holds the rocker to its insulating collar, and
moving it, together with the brushes, until the
best angle has been obtained, then fixing the screw
tightly.

The best materials for brushes are pads of
copper gauze, backed with strips of spring brass,
which gently press the pads, and keep them in
contact with the commutator. The volume of
current obtainable from a machine is influenced

[Page.]

by the lead and angle of contact of its brushes on
the commutator. From time to time these pads
and the commutator must be examined and
repaired, and the worn pads being made good, the
slits between the bars of the commutator wiped
with a piece of card to clear out particles of
copper, then oiled, and the oil wiped off again
with a piece of rag. Beyond keeping all
connections cleaned, and the working parts, bearings,
etc., well oiled, it will be found that the machine
does not require any more attention than that
already indicated.

After the dynamo has been fixed and tested,
connect the leading cables to its terminals, and
lead them to the positions likely to be occupied
by the plating vats. If several of these are likely
to be laid down, or even if only two of such vats
are to be used, it will be advisable to lead the
cables from the machine to a couple of stout
copper rods supported in wooden cleats on the
walls of the plating shop, these rods being
furnished with suitable clamps, and short cables led
from these main arteries to the vats, as shown in
the illustration.

The plating dynamo should be kept thoroughly
clean. The holders should be fitted with springs
to ensure a light even pressure of the brushes
on the commutator. If these press too hard,
they will soon wear deep grooves in the commutator
bars, and if the springs are too light, the
brushes are liable to break contact occasionally,
when the sparks will burn both brushes and
commutator. Keep the tips of the brushes neatly
trimmed square, and free all parts from copper
dust before starting the machine. If the bars
show signs of grooving, throw off the brushes
and work out the grooves with a flat stick covered
with emery cloth, whilst the machine is running
idle, then wipe the commutator with a rag smeared
with vaseline. Always keep the machine well oiled.

[Page.]

Connecting the dynamo with the vat are copper
cables, and for these the following sizes may be
used. For 10 amperes, seven strands of No. 18
S.W.G.; 20 amperes, seven strands of No. 16 S.W.G.;
30 amperes, nineteen strands of No. 18 S.W.G.;
50 amperes, nineteen strands of No. 17 S.W.G.; 75
amperes, nineteen strands of No. 15 S.W.G.; 100
amperes, nineteen strands of No. 14 S.W.G.; 150
amperes, thirty-seven strands of No. 15 S.W.G.;
and for 210 amperes, thirty-seven strands of No. 14
S.W.G. from dynamo to vat. One of the cables
should be in one length. The other cable should
be in two or three lengths, the first from

[Fig. 20.--Conducting and Supporting Rod.]

the dynamo to a resistance board near the vat;
then a short length from the board to the ammeter;
and then a short length from the ammeter
to the vat. It matters very little which line is
thus broken, but it is customary to have the line
leading from the positive terminal of the dynamo
to the anode system on the vat thus divided.
The insulating covering must be stripped from the
ends of the cables, the wires soldered together,
then soldered into suitable connecting sockets.

As it is possible entirely to neutralise the
conducting capacity of a cable by a bad joint or a
bad connection, see to it that all joints are well
made and soldered, and all parts connected by
clamps and under screws made quite clean with
broad surfaces of clean metal in contact with clean
metal at all points.

Each vat must be furnished with two rods of
stout copper or brass (see Fig. 20) running the
whole length of the vat, and furnished with brass
connecting clamps, to connect with the cable lead-

[Page.]

ing from the dynamo. These rods should be 3/4 in.
in diameter for small vats, increasing to 1 in. or
1-1/2 in. for larger vats. It is advisable to have
three such rods when a large quantity of work is
in the vat, the articles to be plated being
suspended from the centre rod, and the anodes from
the two side rods. In this case the two side rods
must be connected together by a stout piece of
cable across the vat, at the end furthest from
the dynamo. The rods must be connected to the
main leads from the dynamo by stout cables,
capable of carrying the full load of current
required.

The slinging wires mentioned on p. 19 depend
from the rods, and have at their lower ends the
hooks which carry the anodes and articles to be
plated.

The resistance board (Figs. 21 and 22) is a slab
of hard wood or slate, furnished with six or more
brass studs on the upper edge, and eight or more
brass contact pieces screwed on in the position
shown. Lengths of stout copper wire, graduating
in size, are fixed to some of the brass pieces and
pass around the studs; then, German silver wires,
offering ten or eleven times the resistance of the
copper wires, are fixed to the remaining pieces
and pass around the other studs, thus forming a
zigzag line of wire of graduated resistance from
one side of the board to the other, as illustrated.
A brass lever is pivoted so as to sweep the
semicircle of brass pieces and make the connection
with each in turn. This central stud may be
connected to a large binding screw at the bottom
of the board, and one end of the cable is fixed to
this screw. At the opposite end of the semicircle,
one of the brass pieces is similarly connected to
another section of the cable.

The resistance board enables the plater to
control the current from the machine; when the
switch lever rests on the contact piece connected

[Page.]

direct to the cable, the circuit has no additional
resistance, but when one of the lengths of copper
wire is thrown into the circuit by moving the
switch lever, resistance is added, and, when the

[Fig. 21.--Resistance.]

[Fig. 22.--Resistance Board, combined with Ammeter.]

lever rests on the last brass piece, all the resistances
are thrown in.  Thus the plater is enabled to
silver a small article safely, even with current
from a very large dynamo.  The switch is equivalent
to a tap in a water-pipe, each wire taken in

[Page.]

by it acting like the plug of a tap in narrowing
the hole through which the water flows. A resistance
board must be placed to each vat to control
the flow of current through it as required by the
plater, and when an ammeter is combined with
the board (as shown in Fig. 22), the current passing
at any time can be seen at a glance.

The ammeter (Fig. 23) measures the current,
and is often fixed to the resistance board for ready
reference (see Fig. 22). As the rate at which the
silver is deposited depends on the current through
the vat, and as the character of the deposit is
greatly influenced by the rate of deposit, this
instrument is of great importance, for by it the
plater can determine how much silver is being
deposited. The dial of an ordinary ammeter
shows the current in amperes, 1 ampere being
that current which will deposit 52 gr. of silver in
one hour on 1 sq. ft. of suitable surface, in a fit
condition for polishing. Thus, in the special
instrument made by T. Morris and Co., Birmingham,
and illustrated by Fig. 23, the lower scale
shows also the weight of silver deposited per hour.

The voltmeter is similar in external appearance
to the ammeter, but the readings on its dial
are in volts. From its readings the plater can
adjust the brushes of a dynamo and regulate its
speed so as to get the right voltage. Experience
has proved that the silver in a silver-plating
solution may be separated from its salt and deposited
in a good condition at as low a pressure as 2 volts;
but this may be increased to 3 or even 4 volts
without altering the condition of the deposit very
much. However, when the pressure exceeds 4
volts, there is a tendency to a loose and powdery
deposit, which gets more pronounced as the pressure
is increased. A voltmeter is therefore useful,
but, its coils being wound with fine wire of high
resistance, it must be placed in a shunt bridging
the two main lines, and furnished with a switch

[Page.]

to cut the voltmeter out of circuit after the
dynamo has been adjusted to the required pressure
(see Fig. 24).

[Fig. 23. --Ammeter showing Rate of Deposit.]

[Fig. 24.--Diagram of Electrical Connections.]

The diagram of electrical connections presented
by Fig. 24 should be carefully studied.

CHAPTER III.

APPLIANCES FOR PREPARING AND FINISHING WORK.

Chief among the appliances used in preparing
rnetal for plating is the polishing lathe. In order
to produce a polish on the work, the first process
is by file, scraper, or some similar tool, to remove
the rough surface the metal has received in forging
or casting; and, to do the work quickly, the
instrument taking the place of the scraper or file
must move at considerable speed, and the article
must be held against it. The same method is
required with the further processes of polishing.
Figs. 25 to 27 show three kinds of machines suitable
for this work.

Fig. 27 illustrates the machine more generally
used where steam power can be applied. The
cast-iron standard is firmly bolted to a block of
wood or stone, and has adjustable bearings at the
top for a circular spindle to revolve in; each
bearing has a lubricator in the centre to supply
the spindle with oil. The spindle has fast and
loose pulleys in the centre, and at the ends devices
to hold the emery-wheel, grindstone, buff, or
dolly, as may be required. The ends of the
spindle should be threaded with a coarse taper
screw which enters a hole in the boss of the
brush or bob, and holds it firm whilst revolving.
Large lathes are furnished with flanged plates at
one end (see Fig. 27) in addition to the taper
screws. These plates support calico mops, and
grip the sides of emery wheels.

Polishing lathes must be firmly bolted down on
benches not liable to great vibration, and run at
a speed of 1,400 revolutions a minute in polishing

[Page.]

silver. For polishing steel or other hard metals
they may be run at a higher speed, up to 2,500
revolutions per minute. The brushes used with

[Fig. 25.--Treadle Polishing Machine.]

[Fig. 26.--Bench Polishing Machine.]

these lathes differ in size and material according
to the work required from them.

A simple machine that may be fixed to an
ordinary bench and worked by foot is illustrated

[Page.]

by Fig. 26. A treadle device is fixed to the floor
and carried by a standard having a plate to secure
it to the bench and an upper pillar to take the
wheel, buff, or dolly. This is the most simple
construction that can be adopted for the work.
The wearing portions are few in number, and can

[Fig. 27.--Power-driven Polishing Machine.]

[Figs. 28 and 29.--Spindles for Mops and Dollies.]

easily be replaced, but considerable speed, say
3,600 revolutions per minute, is easily obtained.
Fig. 25 illustrates a grinding or polishing machine,
having the same treadle movement fixed between
standards, and with a small bench at the top, on
which two bearings for the spindle are fixed.

Alternative forms of spindle are illustrated by

[Page.]

Figs. 28 and 29, which show the various ways in
which the wheels, buffs, etc., may be fixed to suit
the work required to be done.

[Fig. 30.-- Combined Treadle Scratch Brush and Polishing Lathe.]

A combined grinding, polishing and scratch-brushing
machine is illustrated by Fig. 30.
The height of the centre of the spindle is
3 ft. 10 in., and there is provision for two speeds.

[Page.]

A powerful emery wheel machine, arranged for
power driving, is a most useful tool; it is,
indeed, indispensable where much work has first
to be surfaced before it can be polished and plated.

The materials used in polishing metals with
the lathe are: Emery wheels for grinding down
rough forgings and castings; grain emery for use
with bobs in taking out rough file marks and
scratches in iron and steel; fine emery for getting
a better finish; glass-cutter's sand for grinding
brass and gun-metal castings; Trent sand for
taking out rough file marks and scratches in brass;
Sheffield lime for imparting a finish to brass work,
etc.; Tripoli composition of three grades for
finishing nickel-plated work, and also silver-plated
fittings; rouge in several grades and qualities for
finishing silver-plated fittings and nickel-plated
brass work.

Rottenstone and flour emery together make a
good material for polishing iron and steel. The
materials should be formed into a cake or slab by
mixing with boiling suet and then running into
square or oblong moulds, and using cold with the
buffs. Crocus and rottenstone mixed in the same
way with a little rouge form the best combination
for brass or copper and kindred materials. Calico
dollies and mops are used with the powders dry
to give the finishing effects.

In the preparation of articles to be plated,
bobs (or buffs) and mops are employed. Bobs
are of two kinds: one, formed of a disc of
hardwood, having its edge coated with bull-neck
leather (see Fig. 31), while the other is formed of
a solid disc of felt. Other varieties have felt or
buff leather on their rims, whilst some are made
of solid bull-neck, or of walrus leather. The sizes
vary from 3 in. to 18 in. in diameter, and from
3/8 in. to 2 in. in thickness.

To make a wooden bob, first select a piece of
hard, well-seasoned wood and turn a true disc in

[Page.]

a lathe. Then get a strip of the required covering
material as wide as the wood disc, and long
enough to go round and meet with butt edges.
Next prepare some good glue and roll the edge
of the disc in it whilst hot; then put on the
leather or the felt, and secure this to the wood
with long steel tacks, so driven in as to be easily
pulled out when the glue is firm. At the end of
twelve hours these tacks may be withdrawn, and
wooden pegs dipped in glue driven in the holes;

[Figs. 31 to 33.--Leather-covered Bobs.]

then true the whole in a lathe. The bob is then
ready for the grinding material, which may be
emery, sand, or tripoli, the material and grade
being selected to suit the work in hand--emery
for iron and steel, and tripoli for copper and
brass. The abrasive is spread on paper or in
a special trough in an even layer, and the rim
of the bob is first rolled in the hot glue, then on
the layer of powder until a sufficient thickness
has been taken up, then it is set aside for another
twelve hours to get firm. Solid leather or solid
felt bobs are similarly coated. These bobs are
employed to grind down rough surfaces and render
them comparatively smooth.

Fig. 32 illustrates a better plan of making an

[Page.]

emery bob. Four pieces of wood are glued
together with their grains crossing, and then cut
out or turned to circular form. Round the edge
is securely fixed a thick piece of buff leather,
fixed and coated with emery as before. The
centre hole carries a brass boss that is screwed
to fit the end of the spindle, or has a plain hole
to fit on the spindle between the collars, as shown
in Fig. 27, p. 58.

Fig. 33 shows the construction of a leather-covered
bob or buff of large size. The wood is of
wedge-shaped sections, securely fitted and fixed
together and held by brass or iron rings; the
outer edge is covered with leather as before
described.

A solid leather bob with a rim of thick leather,
either bull-neck or sea-horse, may be turned in the
lathe to suit various shapes of mouldings and
ornaments (see Fig. 34). The central holes in
these bobs screw on the point of the spindles
shown in Fig. 27. The article to be polished is
held against them, and the emery powder held
at the point of contact.

A pressed felt bob can be used in place of a
leather bob in many cases, and more often for the
further polishing with crocus or rottenstone. It is
fixed to the spindle in the same way as the leather
bobs already illustrated.

Another method of making a bob may be here
described. It is of wood covered with felt. Two
discs of well-seasoned beech, of the required
diameter and half the thickness of the desired disc,
are glued together side by side, with their grains
opposite, and then left under pressure until quite
firm. The disc is then turned true, and a number
of small grooves are cut in its circumference. A
strip of thick felt of the required width and length
is laid out on a bench, the rim of the wood disc is
run in some good hot glue until well coated and
warm, and is then run along the felt under pres-

[Page.]

sure, the felt being made to cling close to the
wood, and afterwards secured to it with long
tacks. When the glue has become firm and hard,
the tacks are withdrawn, and wooden pegs, dipped
in glue, driven into the holes, as already
described; then the whole is trimmed true with a
sharp knife. The felt-covered disc is rolled in
hot glue, and then coated with emery in the usual
way.

The emery employed in polishing bobs varies
with the work to be done. A bob for the first
roughing down is usually coated with No. 60
emery. Then follow bobs coated with Nos. 80,
120, and 140, the last being used to get a finishing
polish on steel before employing a mop or dolly.
Emery-coated bobs cut iron and steel with great
rapidity. The friction generates heat, and the
article becomes polished, this action being
intensified by the pressure.

To polish quickly a number of articles with the
aid of emery-coated bobs or buffs, arrange them
on a bench at hand, whilst a box, tray, or bench
is placed on the other side. As each article gets
too hot to be held it is thrown into the box, and
another article is reached from the bench, so
treating all in succession, and going over them
again after they have got cool in the box.

For cycle frames and handle-bars, an emery
tape machine (Fig. 35) is preferable to a polishing
lathe and bob. The emery-coated tape or band
is run over pulleys, and the bars are held to it
whilst running; by this means every part of the
bar can be reached easily and can be speedily
polished. In Fig. 54, A shows the spindle for
carrying bob, mop or wheel, B the fast and loose
pulleys, and C the emery tape.

When a polishing lathe is not available, and
a few small and plain articles have to be surfaced,
a buff stick (Fig. 36) may be used. This is a
wooden stick with buff leather firmly glued to it,

[Page.]

the most suitable leather being the tough, rough-grained
leather used in soldiers' belts. Buff sticks
are made in various widths to suit the work in
hand, the broad buffs being used for polishing
broad plane surfaces; and the narrow, thin buff
sticks for giving a polish to grooves and hollows.
They are used with finely-powdered rottenstone
and oil, or with finely-powdered crocus, to give a
finishing polish by hand to articles about to be
plated.

For removing the scratches left by emery bobs,
emery wheels, or tape machines, revolving mops,
known also as dollies, are used. These are of
leather or calico (see Fig. 37), and render the
surface of the metal quite smooth. They are
made chiefly from thin tough leather, such as
basil leather, and chamois leather, and from
various grades of calico, the finest being the soft
variety known as swansdown calico. Basil leather
mops may be from 3 in. to 12 in. in diameter and
from 1/2 in. to 4 in. in thickness. They are made of
several discs of basil leather, cut and laid true
on each other, between two smaller discs of thick
leather, to form the bosses, which are then secured
by long iron rivets passing through the whole mass
of leather. These mops are very useful with
tripoli compo in preparing surfaces of copper,
brass, and other soft metals.

Chamois leather mops are made in a similar
manner, but are chiefly used to produce a high
finish on jewellery. Sometimes these leather mops
are stitched spirally to keep them more compact
whilst revolving.

Calico mops are made similarly. The thickest
and coarsest calico is employed for mops used in
preparing the work with tripoli compo, etc., and
the finer grades for finishing the plated articles
with rouge compo. The bleached varieties of
calico are, as a rule, harsher in texture than the
unbleached, and are used in making the mops for

[Page.]

cutting out scratches, and are then followed by
mops made of unbleached calico charged with

[Fig. 34.--Sections of Bobs.]

[Fig. 35.--Emery Tape Machine.]

[Fig. 36.--Buff Stick.]

[Fig. 37.--Calico Mop.]

rouge compo to give a higher finish. Calico mops
run from 6 in. to 18 in. in diameter, and have

[Page.]

from 50 to 105 folds to the inch of thickness
according to the quality and thickness of calico
employed. Swansdown calico mops run from 6 in.
to 12 in. in diameter, and have from 24 to 60 folds
in thickness, or about 24 folds to the inch.

The polishing mops and materials used in
finishing plated ware should be kept in boxes, to
prevent gritty dust getting into them. Each kind
of mop and polishing compo. should have a
separate box, and special attention should be paid
to guard finishing mops and compos, from
contamination with those of a lower and coarser

[Fig. 38.--Woollen Brush.]

grade. The same remarks
apply to all chamois leather,
rags, soap, and burnishers
employed in finishing
silver-plated articles.

The final polish to brass
and similar soft metals is
given with tripoli in its
various grades, and with
rouge on calico mops, these
also varying in coarseness
or fineness with the
required finish of the work.
Articles to be nickel-plated should be finished off
smooth, so as to leave little polishing afterwards,
because deposited nickel is very hard and not
easily rubbed down with mops. The final polishing
is done with fine grade tripoli and with
Sheffield lime.

Where the article to be polished is very
ornamental and the work very fine, a circular brush
may be employed. This brush may be of fibre
or mixed fibre and bristle. A woollen brush is
shown by Fig. 38. Canning's circular brushes are
of special construction, as is evidenced by the
sectional view given by Fig. 39.

Scouring brushes employed at the scouring
tray are made of coarse bristle or fibre, with

[Page.]

wooden backs and long handles, similar in shape
to plate brushes or spoke brushes, or as shown
by Fig. 40. They are made in various sizes, from
11 in. to 13 in. in length, and with from one to six
rows of bristles, which also vary from soft to stiff
and "extra stiff," to suit the requirements of the

Fig. 39.--Section of Circular Brush.]

[Figs. 40 and 41.--Scouring Brushes.]

work. A scouring brush without a handle is shown
by Fig. 41.

The only brushes admissible in the potash tank
are those made of cotton, two forms of which are
shown at Figs. 42 and 43. They vary in length
from 13 in. to 16 in.

Scratch-brushes are brushes furnished with
bunches of brass wire instead of hair or bristles.

[Page.]

They are made in a great variety of shapes and
sizes, and the wire also varies greatly in softness.
The simplest form is a wisp or bunch of the
scratch-brush wire bound round with soft copper
wire, as shown at Fig. 44. The next is the straight
or bent hand scratch-brush shown by Figs. 45 and

[Figs. 42 and 43.--Potash Brushes.]

[Fig. 44.--Scratch-knot.]

[Figs. 45 and 46.--Hand Scratch-brushes.]

46. Then there are circular brushes in great
variety; and attention is directed to Figs. 47
to 56 (see p. 69), the inscription given to each figure
being sufficient to explain the purpose of the
particular shape.

Large and heavy brushes with coarse wire
are used to cleanse the articles from dirt before

[Page.]

plating. The smaller ones are for brushing silver
deposits when first taken from the vat, and are

[Fig. 47--Brass Wire Brush.]

[Fig. 48.--Crimped Wire Cup Brush.]

[Fig. 49.--Turk's Head Cup Brush.]

[Fig. 50.--End Brush.]

[Fig. 54.--Inside Box Brush.]

[Fig. 55.--Inside Ring Brush.

[Fig. 56.--Bottom Brush.]

[Page.]

made in various shapes to fit peculiarities in
outside surfaces, as well as the inside parts of
teapots, mugs, thimbles, rings, tubes, etc. Some are
furnished with bunches of very fine and soft brass
wire, some with bunches of German silver wire,
and some have the fine wire crimped to make it
more elastic. The softer and finer kinds are used
for gold work and for delicate articles.

These brushes are run on the spindle of an
ordinary light polishing lathe furnished with a
hood or open box over the brush to protect the
workman from splashes of the lubricant; this is
generally stale beer, or beer diluted with water.
Soapy water may be employed as a substitute, but

[Fig. 57.--Scratch Knot Lathe.]

soon becomes offensive after being used; and weak
linseed tea and a decoction of marshmallows
have been employed. The lubricant may be held
in a small cistern over the hood, with a tap and
pipe running down immediately over the scratch-brush.
A tray beneath the brush catches the surplus
drops, which are conveyed by a pipe to a
vessel beneath the bench on which the lathe is
fixed. The lubricant prevents the fine brass dust
worn off the scratch-brush being embedded in the
silver and thus giving it a yellow or stained tint,
only a few drops applied occasionally being
sufficient.

A scratch knot lathe (Fig. 57) is a polishing
lathe upon whose spindle has been mounted a
chuck holding eight or twelve wire scratch knots,
and it forms a most efficient appliance for preparing
work.

CHAPTER IV.

SILVER-PLATING.

The art of silver-plating is an ancient one. Metal
workers in olden times learned how to overlay
inferior metals with plates of silver, and, later,
discovered how to make the silver coat adhere by
soldering to the metal beneath, being then able
to use thinner plates of silver, which were,
however, thick when compared with the thickest
electro-silver-plating now done.

To electro-plate with silver, the article must
be immersed in a solution of silver, and electricity
be passed through this, certain other conditions
being also complied with.

More care must be taken in the cleansing of
articles to be silver-plated than in those to be
electro-gilded. Gold-plating solution is used hot,
and will dissolve remaining traces of animal
matter, but the silver solution is used cold, and
has no such cleansing or detergent effect on dirt
left on the surfaces of goods intended to be
silver-plated. It is necessary, therefore, to free the
surface from the least trace of dirt of any kind,
whether in the form of rust, verdigris, tarnish,
or any other kind of corrosion, or in the form of
oil, grease, lacquer, sweat, or other animal matter.
The touch of a soiled finger on the prepared
surface is sufficient to cause the silver to strip
off from that spot when the scratch-brush or the
burnisher is applied.

All deep scratches, dents, cracks, and pits
must be removed before goods are plated; all
necessary repairs must be done, avoiding an
excess of soft solder; and in the case of re-plating.

[Page.]

all the previous coats of silver or of nickel must
be removed, and the surface polished. Instructions
for stripping electro-deposited metallic coats
are given on pp. 145 and 146.

Rust, verdigris, and other metal oxides can
generally be loosened, and sometimes removed
entirely, by immersing the corroded article in a
pickle made of a diluted mineral acid, or a mixture
of those acids, and then swilling in clean
water. Green verdigris and similar forms of
corrosion may be removed by dipping in a mixture
of equal parts sulphuric acid and water, to which
has been added a half part of nitric acid and a few
drops of hydrochloric acid. The articles should be
strung on a wire, and swilled in the dipping
mixture for a few minutes, until the corrosion has
been loosened, and then rinsed in plenty of clean
water. After this, they may be brushed with an
old scratch-brush, and again swilled in water. If
the verdigris is not all off, they must be again
swilled in the acid pickle until quite clean.

A mixture of 1 part of sulphuric acid in 20
parts of water will loosen the oxides of copper
and zinc on these metals and their alloys. The
alloys of these metals may have many names, but
are to be regarded by the plater as brass, and
treated accordingly. If the surface of a copper
or brass article is deeply corroded and green, it
may be necessary to use a stronger pickle, composed
of 3 parts of sulphuric acid, 1-3/4 parts of
nitric acid, and 4 parts of water. Rust on iron
and steel may be loosened by immersion in a
pickle composed of sulphuric acid 6 parts, muriatic
acid 1 part, water 160 parts. The oxides of lead
and tin may be loosened from these metals and
their alloys (pewter, Britannia metal, soft solder,
etc.) by immersion in a hot solution of caustic
alkali, such as caustic potash or caustic soda.

Lacquered goods must be steeped for an hour
or so in warm methylated spirit, and then trans-

[Page.]

ferred to a strong solution of ammonia, to loosen
the lacquer. They should then be well brushed
with an old scratch-brush or bristle-brush, and
rinsed in hot water. Use old brushes for this
purpose, as it will not be advisable to use the
same brushes for brushing the surfaces of finished
goods.

Mere tarnish may be removed by soaking for a
short time in a strong solution of cyanide of
potassium, to which has been added a few drops
of liquid ammonia.

Metals are often not only corroded, but also
dirty with grease, oil, or other animal matter
capable of resisting the action of acid pickles;
and in such cases it is advisable to swill them first
in the hot alkali solution, then in hot water, and
rinse in cold water before immersion in the acid
pickle. The caustic alkali solution is made by
dissolving 1/2 lb. of caustic soda, or caustic potash, or
crude American potash, in each gallon of water
contained in a wrought-iron tank.

The acid pickles should be mixed and contained
in vessels made of vitrified stoneware. It 
should be understood that vitrified stoneware is
the only suitable material for receptacles for acid
pickles, and plain wrought-iron for those for
caustic alkalies. The mixed acids will undermine
and dissolve the glaze from ordinary earthenware,
and also the enamel from iron. Caustic alkalies
also dissolve enamel, and extract the zinc from
galvanised iron, and the tin from tinned vessels.

For dipping small articles, baskets of the
shapes shown by Figs. 58 to 60 are often very useful.
When the basket is in the pickle it should
be shaken about well to allow the liquid to get
at the entire surface of the work.

After all corrosion and dirt has been loosened,
the surfaces of the articles to be silver-plated
should be well brushed with a hard brush in water
to remove loosened dirt from crevices and pits.

[Page.]

This may be done with an old scratch-brush made
of wire, if preferred. An examination of the
surface will then reveal numerous scratches, dents,
and pits, some being due to corrosive action, and
many to hard usage. These must all be removed,
for the surface must be made like a new surface,
all defects being made good before the silver is
deposited upon it. Dents and misshapen parts
can be put right only with the aid of hammers,
pliers, etc. At one time all scratches and pits
were also laboriously removed by hand, being first
filed and scraped, rubbed with sand or emery,
then with water-of-Ayr stone, and polished with
fine abrading powders. Now the work is nearly
all done on polishing lathes with revolving
brushes, dollies, etc., resulting in a great saving
of time, and in a higher finish (see Chapter III.).

Scratches on the backs of watch-cases and
lockets, and pits left from corrosion in other
articles, must be taken out with a fine file, and
the file marks rubbed out by grinding with
water-of-Ayr stone, after which the surface should be
scoured with a cork dipped in powdered pumice,
then polished bright in the usual way. Spoons
and forks should receive similar treatment.
Although the cleansing of goods to be silver-plated
is so important, there is no need for such a very
finely polished surface for silver-plating as for
electro-gilding, since the coat of silver can be got
up afterwards; but the same care will be needed
to get a uniform surface, free from scratches and
pits.

After the polishing, the articles will be found
to be thinly coated with grease or oil, which is
removed by swilling in the hot caustic alkali
pickle, and rinsing in water. This process will
probably coat copper, brass, and similar soft alloys
with a film of black oxide which must be removed
by scouring. For this purpose, the article is held
on the tray with the plater's left hand, the scour-

[Page.]

ing brush is dipped in water, the surplus shaken
out, the brush dipped in the pumice powder, and
the article is then brushed to and fro until every
trace of oxide is removed. When it is rinsed in
water, it should be quite clean, with a uniformly
dull surface all over it, which renders the surface
suitable to take and hold the silver coat.

The article must now be wired--that is, attached
to the wire which will hold it in the plating
solution--then rinsed in the mercury pickle to

[Figs. 58 to 60. --Dipping Baskets.]

impart a thin coat of mercury, again rinsed in
water and transferred to the plating bath (for the
composition of which, see pp. 79 to 81), where
deposition should begin at once. However, in
many cases, a preliminary coating with copper is
necessary.

Iron, steel, and zinc goods, and, preferably,
also those of lead and its alloys, such as pewter
and Britannia metal, must be coated with copper
after they have been scoured, before they can be
made to take an adherent coat of silver. Silver

[Page.]

may be made to adhere to lead alloys with skilful
treatment without this coat, but the work
is done more easily and better when thus coated.
The solution employed must be an alkaline one,
as acid solutions, by their action on iron, steel,
and zinc, undermine the deposit of copper and
render it loose. The alkaline coppering solution
is prepared by dissolving copper sulphate in hot
rainwater in the proportion of 8 oz. of copper
sulphate to 1 quart of water. When this has
become cold enough, add first liquor ammonia to
throw down the copper in the form of green mud,
and then an extra quantity of ammonia to dissolve
this mud and convert the whole into a bright
blue liquid. To this must be added a sufficient
quantity of potassium cyanide solution to take
all the blue colour out and make the solution
amber-tinted, or the colour of old ale. It should
then be left exposed to the air for twelve hours,
then filtered through calico, and diluted with
clean rainwater until each original quart is made
up to one gallon of solution. This solution may
be worked hot or cold, but gives a fine clear
deposit of copper when heated to 160° F. and worked
with current from a plating dynamo. Anodes of
pure copper must be employed.

When the articles of iron, steel, zinc, lead,
pewter, and similar alloys, or those of brass with
soft-soldered joints, are lightly coated with copper,
they may be removed from the coppering
bath to the alkaline mercury solution, and be
there given a thin film of mercury, then rinsed
and transferred to the silver-plating bath without
delay. "Quicking," or coating with quicksilver,
is done to secure the perfect adherence of the
silver coating. The alkaline quicking solution
is made by dissolving mercury slowly in dilute
nitric acid, then adding enough strong solution of
potassium cyanide to throw down the mercury in
the form of black mud, and an extra quantity

[Page.]

(with stirring) to dissolve this mud. Distilled
water only must be used in making this solution,
and it should contain 1 oz. of mercury in each
gallon. Some free cyanide must also be added to
act on the copper and ensure a bright film of
mercury Potassium cyanide is a most deadly
poison, and should not be held in the naked hand.

The acid solution of mercury proto-nitrate is
employed and preferred by some platers. This
is the first solution of mercury in nitric acid,
largely diluted with distilled water. Its action is
more speedy than that of the alkaline solution,
but the film of mercury is not so thin and uniform
as that from the latter. To prepare the mercury
proto-nitrate solution, dissolve a few drops of
mercury slowly in a mixture of equal parts nitric
acid and distilled water, using only enough acid
to dissolve all the mercury; then dilute the whole
to twenty times its bulk with distilled water.
Swill the articles in this when they are ready for
the plating bath, and then rinse in clean water.

In professional plating, it is customary to
weigh each article separately, or each group
separately, to book the weights, and to determine the
weight of silver to be deposited. In all plating,
an estimate should be made of the surfaces in
square inches, so that the anode surfaces and
resistances may be adjusted so as to put on a tough
coat of silver that will bear polishing and
burnishing. This estimate must be based on experience
with the silver solution in use; but, as a
commencement, allow two amperes to each 100 sq. in.
of surface to be covered, and then find out by
actual weighing what quantity of silver has been
deposited in an hour. If this deposit is tough,
adherent, and in good condition for polishing, the
rate of deposit may be increased by lowering the
resistance and using more current; but this should
be done gradually, until the highest rate of
deposit from the solution has been ascertained. The

[Page.]

rate, as indicated on the ammeter, will vary with
the condition of the solution, the size of the anode
surface, the distance of the anode plates from the
articles, the voltage, and the character of the
surface to be coated. A solution containing only one
ounce of silver in the gallon will not yield good
results except with feeble currents. If the anode
surface is greatly in excess of the surface to be
coated, the deposit will be rough and brittle, and
a similar result may follow if the anode plates are
too close to the articles. If the voltage is too
high a similar result will be obtained, and if the
articles have many sharp angles, edges, and
points, these parts may take on a brittle coat of
silver unless the current is kept low. If the
anodes can be kept in motion whilst deposition
is going on, or if both anodes and cathodes are
kept moving, all the conditions previously
mentioned will be greatly modified, and the rate of
deposition may be safely increased.

The appearance of the silver coat whilst in the
solution is a guide to its condition. The surface
should momentarily change from grey to white
and assume the whiteness of the anode plates in
the course of two minutes. If it becomes more
grey and bubbles arise from the slinging wire, the
silver is going on too fast and the deposit is
being "burnt." If it becomes brown it is still
going on too fast. If it maintains a milky whiteness
(a skim-milk white with a tinge of blue), it
may be going on rather more slowly than is
necessary. The rate of deposition may be regulated
by moving the switch on the resistance board,
and in a well-made silver-plating solution a
deposit of one ounce of silver per hour can be
obtained with a current of eight amperes, two ounces
with sixteen amperes, and so on.

Deposition at the proper rate should be allowed
to go on for from ten minutes to fifteen
minutes, then each article should be taken out

[Page.]

separately, rinsed in water, and scratch-brushed
all over to test the adherence of the deposit and
its condition. If this is satisfactory, the articles
should be swilled in the potash and mercury dips,
then rinsed and placed again in the plating bath
until a sufficient time has elapsed to get the
required coat of silver on them.

The silver-plating solution has been mentioned
many times, but the method of preparing it has
not yet been explained. This, however, will now
be done.

The best solution for silver-plating is the
double cyanide of silver and potassium in distilled
water. This salt may be made direct from pure
silver plates or grains by first dissolving the metal
in pure nitric acid diluted with distilled water,
then evaporating all excess acid until silver nitrate
crystals are obtained; then dissolve these in
distilled water, and add a solution of potassium
cyanide to form a curdy precipitate of the single
cyanide, and finally dissolve this with a strong
solution of potassium cyanide to form the double
salt of silver and potassium.

But, as the reduction of silver to its nitrate is
tedious and noisome, pure silver nitrate is usually
obtained from a druggist or drysalter. It is
dissolved in distilled water, and then converted
into the double cyanide of silver and potassium
as above indicated. In doing this, to prevent
waste of silver, care must be taken to avoid adding
the cyanide solution in large quantities at a
time. The precipitate must also be well stirred
with a clean smooth stick of wood after each
addition of cyanide, and only enough of this added
to throw down all the silver. When precipitation
is complete, which is shown by all cloudiness
disappearing from the liquid above the precipitate,
the liquid must be carefully poured off and taken
to the waste tub, and the precipitate of silver
cyanide well washed by pouring clean water on it

[Page.]

several times, so as to agitate it well; then drain
it as dry as possible. To this wet mass of silver
curds add a strong solution of the best potassium
cyanide in distilled water, until all the curds have
been dissolved. The quantity of cyanide in the
solution should have been ascertained by weighing
the dry salt previous to its dissolution; then
add one-fifth in excess to provide enough free
cyanide of potassium to dissolve the silver anodes
in working and thus maintain the strength of the
plating solution. The whole concentrated silver
solution must next be filtered through well-washed
calico, and added to the distilled water previously
placed in the vat intended to contain the
silver-plating solution; it will then be ready for use.

The amount of silver in solution needs a word
of explanation. Although good silver-plating may
be turned out of solutions varying considerably in
strength, it is of great importance to the plater
to know how much silver is contained in the solution,
and this may vary from 2 oz. to 6 oz. per gal.
If grain or sheet silver is employed in preparing
the solution, its strength may be easily ascertained;
but a little calculation is necessary when
silver nitrate is used, for in every 170 oz. of silver
nitrate there are only 108 oz. of silver.

The method of preparing small quantities of
silver-plating solution is as follows: Obtain 2 oz.
of the best crystallised silver nitrate and dissolve
it in 1 qt. of distilled water. Also obtain 2 oz. of
best potassium cyanide and dissolve it in 1 pt. of
distilled water. Add this a little at a time to the
silver nitrate solution, and stir well each time with
a glass rod until no white curdy precipitate is
caused by the addition of a few drops. Allow the
white curds to settle well down, then pour off all
the liquid. Pour on clean water, allow the curds
to settle again, and repeat the process several
times; finally, drain off as much of the water as
possible. Dissolve these white curds in a solution

[Page.]

of potassium cyanide and add a little surplus to
make it work freely. Use anode plates of pure
silver, and work cold in a stoneware or glass
vessel with current from two Smee cells, or from
two or three Daniell cells.

For making a large quantity (say 150 gal.) of
silver-plating solution to contain 3 oz. of silver per
gallon, 450 oz. of silver will be required. As there
are 108 oz. of metallic silver in 170 oz. of silver
nitrate, 45 lb. avoirdupois of silver nitrate will be
required, and about 30 lb. or more of best grey
potassium cyanide, to convert the silver nitrate
into the double cyanide of silver and potassium.
About 230 gal. of distilled water will also be
required. First well wash the plating vat and carefully
sponge out all dirty water, then half fill the vat
with distilled water. Next half fill a large stoneware
or earthenware pan with distilled water and
dissolve therein some of the silver nitrate in the
proportion of 1 lb. of the silver salt to each gallon
of water. Stir with a glass or clean wood rod
until all the silver crystals are dissolved. Then
dissolve some of the potassium cyanide in distilled
water, in the proportion of 1/2 lb. to 1/2 gal.,
and add this carefully, whilst stirring, to the silver
nitrate solution as long as it causes white curds
or clouds. Now allow to settle, carefully pour off
all the water, and throw this away. Then pour on
fresh spring water to wash the silver curds well,
and pour all this water away. Next dissolve all
the curds in a strong solution of potassium
cyanide, and pour this solution into the plating
vat through a calico filter. Proceed thus until
all has been prepared and added to the first lot
in the plating vat. Then add 5 lb. more of potassium
cyanide, previously dissolved, to form free
cyanide. The voltage necessary to work this
solution is from four to five volts. The current in
amperes is in proportion to the surface of goods
immersed in the solution at any one time, so may

[Page.]

range from 1 to 100 amperes. The safe rate is
found by experience, and varies with the character
of the work in hand.

The plating solution should be kept in good
working order. Only distilled water should be
allowed in it, and it should always be kept up
to a certain mark and thus maintained at the same
strength. No chemicals of any kind, except
potassium cyanide, should be added to the solution,
and this must be used cautiously. A certain
quantity of free cyanide must always be present
in the plating solution to dissolve the silver anodes
at a rate equal to that of the silver deposited.
Then the anodes are not coated with black slime,
providing all other necessary conditions are
fulfilled; but a slimy condition of anodes may be
due to an insufficiency of silver in the solution or
to an accumulation of dirt. Too much free
cyanide in the solution will be shown by a coarse
crystalline condition of the anode surface and
rapid erosion of the edges of the anode plates,
which soon become ragged. In this solution the
deposit is liable to become loose on copper, brass,
and other metals readily dissolved in cyanide
solutions.

In making silver solutions, only the best potassium
cyanide should be used; this is sold under
the name of best grey potassium, 99 per cent.
cyanide. Inferior cyanide may be employed for
pickling solutions; but, because it contains a
large percentage of uncombined potash salts, it
should not be used in plating solutions, as these
too soon become charged with an excess of potash
salts, caused by a gradual withdrawal of cyanogen
from the free potassium cyanide in solution. In
process of time this excess of potash renders the
old plating solution unfit for use, as shown by its
muddy appearance, and by the rough character of
the silver deposited from it.

If the muddiness of the plating solution is

[Page.]

caused by dirt, filter the whole solution through
good calico. This dirt may consist of dust from
the workshop, carbon from the potassium cyanide,
and finely divided silver from the anodes; it
should therefore be saved and put in with the
waste rinsing water to recover the silver.

All water suspected to contain silver should
be saved and evaporated in an enamelled iron
vessel, the resulting salt being mixed with waste
sawdust and sold to a refiner.

If a silver-plating bath is exposed to strong
sunlight, a small portion of the free cyanide will
absorb carbonic dioxide from the air and part
with its cyanogen, and thus become converted into
potassium carbonate. The loss of free cyanide
may easily be made up by adding a small portion
of potassium cyanide dissolved in distilled water.
When silver-plating baths are not in use, they
should be closely covered to prevent this loss, and
to keep out dust. They should also be well stirred
an hour or two before being used again.

As the silver salts will creep up the sides of
the vat, and thus find their way to the floor, it is
necessary to wash them back into the vat with a
little distilled water applied with a stout brush
almost every day. An abundance of clean water
must be provided for rinsing, and the rinsing
waters must be frequently changed. Failure in
securing an adherent deposit of silver may often
be traced to the use of dirty rinsing waters.

The anode plates, which serve the double purpose
of conveying the current into the solution
and also keeping up its strength, must be of pure
annealed silver, and their surfaces should always
slightly exceed the surfaces of all the articles
immersed at any one time. If they fall short
of this for any length of time the solution will
become impoverished, and, on the other hand, if
their surface is excessive, the solution may get
too rich. They should be easily removable.

[Page.]

Standard silver must not be employed for the
anodes, as it contains 7-1/2 per cent, of copper.
French silver coins contain even a higher
percentage of copper; therefore coin silver must not
be used at all, or the deposited silver will be hard
and of a bad colour. The plates may be of any
size and length suitable to the vat and work, but
should not be less than 1/8 in. in thickness. If kept
moving whilst at work, the lower edges rapidly
wear thin, and the plates should be reversed to
wear both ends equally. This is also necessary if
the plates remain stationary, as they are then
liable to be cut through at the top of the solution.

Anode plates are usually suspended from the
anode rods by hooks of pure silver wire, holes
being punched in the upper edges of the plates
for this purpose. The anode rods may be kept in
motion if they are made to hang on a steel frame
moved to and fro by machinery. The frame should
have broad steel rollers running on steel rails, and
these must be connected to the positive pole of
the dynamo. Steel is preferable to other metals
because it is not readily corroded by potash salts
or cyanide.

Boxwood furnishes the best sawdust for drying
silver-plated goods, as it does not contain dye,
acid, or resin liable to stain pure silver. But if
the sawdust is heated in a vessel by direct contact
with flame, it will become charred, and in this
condition will stain silver. The pan containing
the sawdust should therefore always have a water
or steam jacket. The goods may be dried thus in
clean boxwood sawdust without spotting or
tarnishing, and, in this clean condition, are more
easily given a high finish.

Some notes on silver-plating a few particular
articles will now be given.

In silver-plating a cruet frame, if it is to be
highly polished in every part, it will be necessary
to disconnect the parts where they are soft-sol-

[Page.]

dered, and polish each separately. But this is not
usually done, as cruet frames thus soldered are of
common quality, and best plating is not expected
on them. In best quality cruet frames all parts
are put together with screws, and by simply
withdrawing these, every portion of the cruet can be
got at with the polishing mops. The bases of some
old cruet frames sent to be re-plated are often
so pitted with corrosion as to render a smooth polish
impossible. If they must be made like new, and
there is no other method of doing this, it will be
advisable to fill in the pits with solder; then
grind the whole level, and polish the surface
before plating. This, and all parts coated with
soft solder, must be coated with copper before
they are silver-plated. Joints may be coated with
copper by rubbing with wet copper sulphate and
a bunch of fine iron wire. Large surfaces must
be coppered in an alkaline coppering bath.

It is not usual to silver-plate tinware, but
when it is necessary, it must be cleaned by scouring
with potash on a cotton mop; it is then rinsed
in a hot solution of potash, and coated with
copper in an alkaline coppering solution before it
is immersed in the silver-plating solution. Silver
does not firmly adhere to tin, but will firmly
adhere to copper; hence the advisability of first
coating the tin with a thin layer of copper. As
tin is a very soft metal, it can be easily scratched,
even with a soft cotton brush not quite free from
dust and grit. If, therefore, a bright surface is
desired on the lightly silvered tinware, this may
only be rinsed in the hot potash without scouring,
very lightly coppered in a good solution, transferred
promptly to the silvering vat and given only
a thin coat of silver.

Generally, pure tin, pure lead, and their alloys,
irrespective of proportions, such as soft solder,
pewter, and Britannia metal, are treated in a
special manner in preparing them to receive an

[Page.]

electro-deposited coat of silver. When thoroughly
cleaned and ready for plating, each article is
swilled in a hot solution of potash and transferred
at once, without rinsing, to the plating solution,
where the deposit is struck by a vigorous current
at first, but the current is reduced to finish the
deposit slowly. Such metals cannot be quicked
in a mercury solution unless they have a coat of
copper or of brass deposited on them previous to
immersion in the solution. This is sometimes
done, and is a safe method for novices in the art,
but requires the same preparation as for
silver-plating direct. All such metals should be lightly
scratch-brushed and polished after they are coated
with silver.

For silvering the inside of a tin-plate teapot,
well scour it with powdered Bath brick or Trent
sand until quite bright; then well rinse in potash
water, and fill, whilst still wet, with a good
alkaline coppering solution. Connect the teapot by a
copper wire to the negative pole of the plating
dynamo, and suspend a strip of copper in the pot
by a wire connected to the positive pole, and see
that this wire does not touch the vessel. In a few
minutes the inside should be coated with a thin
film of bright copper; then pour out the coppering
solution, and substitute a silver-plating solution,
and a strip of silver instead of the copper strip.
Deposit silver in the teapot until of the required
thickness; then pour out the silver solution, rinse
with hot water, scratch with a soft wire brush, and
polish lightly.

For silver-plating a sword and sheath, two vats,
each not less than 4 ft. long and 1 ft. 6 in. wide,
will be necessary. Fill one with an alkaline
coppering solution, and the other with the silver
cyanide plating solution. The sword must be
freed from grease, etc., by scouring in the potash
pickle, then lightly coated with the alkaline
coppering solution, rinsed in clean water, quicked in

[Page.]

a cyanide of mercury solution, and lightly silvered
in the silver-plating solution, then scratch-brushed
and polished. The sheath must be treated in a
similar manner, but care must be taken to remove
first the wooden strips which form the lining. To
do this, it will probably be necessary to take out
a set screw in the collar, and remove this, then
loosen the strips of wood with a knife and draw
them out. A plug of wood should be put in the
screw hole, and the head of the screw should only
be lightly plated. Both sword and sheath must
be slung horizontally in the baths, and the sheath
should be given a heavier plating than the sword.
The insides of tea-pots, coffee-pots, and similar
vessels have often to be plated and to be in a
bright and finished condition in every part. It is
quite possible to reach the insides of ordinary
vessels with suitable scratch-brushes, but there
are always some interstices in ornamental and
chased work that cannot possibly be reached by
mechanical means, and it would never do to leave
those parts with the dull white or "matt" coating
left upon them when finished in an ordinary
silver-plating solution. It is, therefore, usual to make
up a special brightening solution to deposit a
bright coat of silver on the finished article. The
solution for bright plating is made up as follows:
Take 1 pt. of old silver-plating (cyanide) solution,
and add to it from 2 oz. to 3 oz. of bisulphide
of carbon. Put this in a glass-stoppered bottle
capable of holding 1/2 gal. of liquid, and add
to it 3 pt. more of the old plating solution; then
shake the bottle well for a few minutes, and set
aside to rest for twenty-four hours or more.
Carefully decant the bright liquid into another
similar bottle without disturbing the sediment,
and add from 2 oz. to 3 oz. of good cyanide of
potassium dissolved in distilled water. Shake up
the contents of the bottle to mix them, and when
all is settled down again, the mixture will be fit

[Page.]

for use. The daily dose of this liquid to the
bright-plating solution must only be in the
proportion of 2 fluid oz. to each 20 gal. of solution.
This should be added at the close of each day's
work, and be well stirred into the plating solution.
If too much brightening solution is added, the
deposit will be brown, or marked with black or
brown streaks, and the solution spoiled. It should
never be added to the ordinary plating solutions,
since they are apt to be spoiled for other work
by the addition of the brightening solution.

The work in course of brightening should be
closely watched. The brightening effects will
begin at the bottom of the article and spread
upwards; when the article is covered, it should be
removed at once, and quickly rinsed in warm
water. As bisulphide of carbon is an evil-smelling,
poisonous liquid, of a volatile nature, great
care must be exercised in its use, so as not to
breathe the foetid vapour, the odour of which
resembles that of rotting cabbage. The worker is
warned against sniffing at the bottle containing
bisulphide of carbon or brightening solution.

Some special instructions may be given on the
treatment of the various little oddments that come
to the country jeweller to be re-plated, such as
alberts, charms, lockets, brooches, buckles, scarf-pins,
rings, and one or two spoons or sugar-tongs.
The small jeweller is not advised to imdertake
the job of plating spoons and forks in dozens, or
anything larger than a dessert spoon, as larger
articles demand more room than can be found
in the small vat of a working jeweller, and more
anode surface than he has at his command; but
there is no reason why he should not profitably
engage in the plating of small articles. If he
does, he will find the following notes particularly
useful. The preparation of the articles by boiling
in alkali, rinsing, scratch-brushing, scouring, and
quicking has already been described. Each article

[Page.]

must be hung to a long hook made of copper wire,
and suspended by this in the solution whilst
receiving its coat of silver. For very small articles
this hook may be made of No. 28, whilst for larger
articles it may be made of No. 20. This hook is
made in the form of an S, the lower end hooking
behind a pin, into a bow, into a link, or to some
projecting part of the trinket. The articles should
be wired with wet hands before the final dips, and
not touched with the hands afterwards, but placed
straight away into the plating solution, suspended
to the cathode rod attached to the zinc of the
battery. Two or three cells in series will be
enough to force current through the wires and
deposit the silver in good condition. The articles
should be coated white with silver within a few
minutes of placing them in the depositing vat.
They should then be taken out and brushed with
a clean scratch-brush in clean water, to test the
adherence of the deposit. If this does not strip,
the article must be rinsed in clean water, and
restored to the vat to receive a finish coat. The
time taken to do this will depend upon the price
to be paid for plating, since a longer time in the
vat represents a thicker coat of silver. By
carefully weighing the article after it is polished,
preparatory to plating, and weighing again when
dried, after it has been plated, the weight of
silver deposited upon it can be found. A thick
coat of good adherent silver may be deposited in
two hours; but the time taken will always depend
upon the condition of battery and solution. It may
be said that for sixpence a trinket only a mere
blush of silver over and above the scratch-brush
coat can be allowed, and this may be laid on in a
few minutes.

CHAPTER V.

COPPER-PLATING.

Copper is a highly malleable, ductile, and tenaceous
red metal very largely used in the industrial
arts. It does not resist the action of acids, and
even moisture affects it, causing it to form an
oxide known as verdigris; this, under the action
of carbonic acid, turns to green copper carbonate.
Copper is also caused to oxidise by heat; it is
volatile only at a great heat. It has a specific
gravity of 8.9, and melts at 2,000° F. Commercial
copper contains many impurities, amongst them
being iron, silver, bismuth, antimony, arsenic,
cuprous oxide, lead, tin, and sulphur. Copper is
much used in its commercially pure state, but is
greatly in demand as the chief ingredient of the
important brass and bronze alloys.

The metals on which a coat of copper is deposited
by electricity are lead and its alloys; tin
and its alloys; iron, tinned iron; zinc; and steel.
When articles made of these metals are to be
silver-plated, nickel-plated, or gilded, it is
always advisable and sometimes necessary
previously to coat them with copper. This cannot
be done in a copper sulphate solution, because
the acid in this dissolves the metals.

The merits and demerits of copper-plating as
part of a preparatory process to nickel-plating for
cycle work may be discussed briefly. Skilful
hands, old in the trade and experienced, ridicule
the idea of having to coat with copper before
putting on a coat of nickel. An experienced hand
can deposit nickel direct on iron and steel, and
the nickel will adhere firmly, but the novice is

[Page.]

advised first to copper all steel and iron parts of
cycles, and thus save himself much after-trouble.
The reason for this lies in the fact that copper will
adhere to iron and steel more firmly than nickel
does, and nickel will adhere firmly to copper.
Another point in favour of copper-plating is, that
it enables the plater to see whether the articles
are perfectly clean or not, for copper will not
deposit firmly on dirty iron or steel, and the coat
strips off (when subjected to scratch-brushing)
from all dirty patches. The nickel deposit can
also be better seen on copper than on iron, and
the progress of the depositing process watched.
Copper will also enter into fine pinholes and
cracks, and stop them, whilst nickel goes on
around such spots, and leaves them open to the
action of damp. A coat of copper, then, after
the work has been scoured, is recommended, and this
coat should be well scratch-brushed, dipped in the
cyanide dip, and rinsed before placing the article
in the nickel-plating solution. If a special job
is in hand, a thick coat of copper should be
deposited, and this well burnished all over to make
sure of perfect adherence, then scoured to give
a slight roughness to the burnished surface. A
coat of brass will do quite as well as copper if
a good brassing solution happens to be available.

When articles are badly pitted with deep rust-spots
and scale from forgings, or castings have
their surfaces full of small sand-holes, this
previous coppering process enables the plater to fill
in all such defects with solder, get a smooth
surface on the defective spots, and coat the whole
with copper. The best way of soldering such pits
is by means of a chloride of zinc flux, applied with
a spoon of copper wire which is always left in the
flux, and thus contaminates it with a little chloride
of copper. A slight film of copper is thus
deposited on iron and steel, to which the solder
adheres perfectly. This patching must be done

[Page.]

before the articles are polished, in order that the
patches may be made quite smooth before placing
them in the coppering solution. Articles thus
patched must not be left long in the potash-vat,
because this alkali will dissolve solder readily,
although it has no action on iron.

Only a thin film of copper is necessary to form
a basis for the deposit of nickel. When this has
been obtained uniformly all over the article,
remove it from the coppering solution, and test its
adherence with the brass wire scratch-brush
lubricated with water. If the copper comes off from
any part, give the faulty spot a good scouring
with whiting; rinse well in clean water, and give
the whole article an extra coat of copper, placing
one of the anodes near the fault, so as to cover
it at once with copper. If the coat of copper is
good and perfect, rinse it well in clean water, and
place the article at once in the nickel-plating
solution, unless it has been determined to burnish
the coat. If the coat has been burnished, give the
article a dip in the cyanide solution, to remove
any tarnish caused by the action of the air; then
rinse it, and place it in the nickel solution.

Although copper can be easily deposited from
an alkaline solution, it requires some amount of
skill to deposit the metal in a tough condition fit
for burnishing.

Various solutions have been used for copper-plating;
but the most successful one is made as
explained on p. 76 of the previous chapter. Its
usual proportions are: Copper sulphate, 4 oz.;
potassium cyanide, 12 oz.; liquid ammonia, 4 oz.;
rainwater, 4 gal. Distilled water may be used
instead of rainwater, but spring and river waters
are not suitable because of the earthy matters
held by them. The solution should be held in an
enamelled iron vessel.

The following is a typical copper-plating solution:
Dissolve 1 lb. of copper sulphate in 1/2 gal.

[Page.]

of rainwater, then stir in enough liquor ammonia
to throw down the copper in the form of a green
precipitate, and dissolve this to make a blue
liquid. Dilute this with an equal bulk of
rainwater, then add sufficient potassium cyanide to
destroy the blue tint and produce the colour of
old ale. Filter the whole through calico and
expose to the action of air for twenty-four hours,
when it should be ready for use. Work it cold or
hot.

Enough free cyanide should be present in the
coppering solution to dissolve the copper anodes
easily, but an excess of free cyanide should be
avoided when the tension of the current is high,
and the copper solution is impoverished. It is
necessary to add some good cyanide of potassium
to the solution from time to time, as found
necessary, to keep up the supply of free cyanide; but
as cyanide itself does not freely dissolve the oxide
of copper formed on the anodes, a little liquor
ammonia also should be added occasionally to
assist the action of the cyanide. This is preferable
to a large excess of free cyanide in the solution.
Anode plates of pure copper must be employed;
these are connected by No. 16 S.W.G. copper
wire to the positive pole of the generator.
If the plates do not dissolve freely, but become
encrusted with a green slime, a small quantity
of potassium cyanide and of liquid ammonia
should be added to the solution. The best
electro-deposited pure copper should be selected for
anode plates. Discarded Daniell battery-plates
will serve the purpose very well. All other
conditions being equal, employ an anode surface slightly
in excess of that of the articles being plated.
The rate of deposit can be regulated by exposing
more or less anode surface. Too little anode surface
may result in a hard, dark deposit of copper,
if the tension of the current is high. Too much

[Page.]

anode surface may result in a loose, soft deposit
of copper, which will peel off when scratch-brushed.
This may be remedied by altering the
resistance board, and interposing a higher
resistance in circuit. Too much anode surface tends
to make the solution rich in copper, and this
condition also favours a rapid deposit, which may be
loose under certain other conditions, such as too
much free cyanide and too much current. On the
other hand, too little anode surface tends to an
impoverishment of the solution, and consequent
hard, dark, and unequal deposits of metal.
Unfavourable conditions may be remedied by moving
the articles nearer to or farther from the anodes,
in addition to the means already proposed.

If the solution is kept supplied with free
cyanide and free ammonia it may be worked with
a current at from 6 to 8 volts; but the deposit may
be improved by heating the solution to from 150°
F. to 170° F., and the vat may then be worked at
from 4 to 6 volts. The best generator is a plating
dynamo, the next a three-cell accumulator; and
among primary batteries the next best would be
four 1/2 gal. Bunsen cells.

The surfaces of all articles to be copper-plated
must be cleaned and prepared. Iron and steel
articles may be cleaned from rust by steeping and
swilling in a pickle composed of 6 fluid oz. of
sulphuric acid and 1/2 oz. of muriatic acid in each
gallon of water. They must then be rinsed in clean
water and immersed in a pickle composed of 1/2 lb.
of American potash dissolved in each gallon of
hot water. If the surfaces have been pitted, the
corroded parts must be polished with emery held
on a mop in a polishing lathe, after which the
articles must be well swilled in the hot potash
pickle to free them from oil or grease. All
surfaces must be well polished before the copper is
deposited, because the thin coat will not permit
much polishing afterwards.

[Page.]

Articles made of lead and tin, or their alloys,
must be first scoured with sand and water, using
a hard brush for the purpose, to free them from
oxide; then rinsed in the hot potash pickle; again
scoured with finer sand to polish them; wired
with short lengths of No. 24 S.W.G. soft copper
wire; again rinsed in the hot potash pickle, and
transferred direct to the plating vat. The potash
pickle will prevent rust forming on iron and steel
articles, and will clear oxide from lead and tin
and their alloys; but it is advisable to transfer
the articles quickly to the plating vat, and not to
rinse them in water on the way.

Zinc articles are cleansed in a similar manner;
but very fine sand or finely powdered bath brick
must be used in scouring. If articles are bright
and free from rust and tarnish, only a light
brushing with a vegetable fibre brush in the potash
pickle will be necessary to prepare them.

The actual process of copper-plating will now
be described. Each article must be attached to a
short length of copper wire, which suspends it
in the vat. Use No. 24 S.W.G. for small articles,
and No 18 s.w.G. for heavy ones. Each article
should be held by the slinging wire during the
final rinse, and the free end of this wire is bent
over a brass rod on the plating vat, attached to
the negative pole of the generator. Move each
article to and fro with a rinsing movement when
placing it in the vat, to remove any air bubbles
on the surface. The current should be regulated
by a resistance, usually a long length of German
silver wire furnished with a switch. The
resistance can also be increased by diminishing the
surface of the anode exposed to the plating
solution, and by placing the anode further from the
article being plated. If the current is too strong,
the deposited copper will be dark in colour and
loose in character, and this will also happen if
the solution contains too much copper. Move-

[Page.]

ment of the articles whilst being plated will assist
in securing a bright and smooth deposit. Some
gas is given off from the articles whilst deposition
is going on, but this should be regulated by
adjusting the current. Only a few minutes is
required for plating each article.

The plated articles should be rinsed in plenty
of clean water to free them from cyanide and
copper salts. If the surface is to remain coppery,
the article should be rinsed in hot water, placed
at once in hot bran or hot sawdust, and moved
about in it until quite dry and bright. Pure
copper readily tarnishes in the air when damp,
but may be brightened with a scratch-brush.

If the surface is to be nickel-plated, the articles
must be rinsed and transferred at once to the
nickel-plating vat. If a thicker deposit of copper
is desired, use an electrotyping solution, after
depositing a thin film of copper in the alkaline
solution above mentioned. If the plated articles are
to be gilded, get a very thin and bright deposit
of copper, or brighten it with a scratch-brush;
then rinse and transfer at once to the gilding vat.
If they are to be silver-plated, coat with a thin
film of mercury before placing them in the
silver-plating solution; give a brisk swill in the quicking
solution (p. 76), and then rinse in clean water.

For copper-plating sheet lead, first scour the
lead plates clean with sand and water, then
briskly rinse them in a solution of pearlash (1 lb.
to the gallon), and transfer from this direct to the
copper-plating solution without handling or
previous rinsing in water. Use a current at from
6 to 8 volts. If the first deposit is coarse and
loose, remove the plates and well brush them in
water with a hard fibre brush, again rinse in the
potash or pearlash solution, and return to the
copper-plating bath, using a reduced anode
surface, or keep the plates moving whilst being
plated. In this way a bright facing of copper may

[Page.]

be obtained, which must be well rinsed and dried
quickly to prevent tarnishing. Electro-deposited
copper rapidly tarnishes in air when damp.

Occasionally, a piece of carbon has to be
copper-plated for the purpose of soldering
something to it. The coppering is easily done by the
following process: Dissolve copper sulphate in
warm water until the water will not dissolve any
more. Place this copper solution in a large
battery jar, or similar stoneware vessel, and select
a porous battery jar to stand up in the centre.
In the porous pot place a rod or plate of
amalgamated zinc in a solution of sulphuric acid
(1 part acid to 12 parts water), and suspend the
carbons from a wire attached to this zinc with
their ends only dipping in the copper solution.
See that the ends to be coppered are quite clean
and specially free from grease. In the course
of half an hour enough copper will be electro-deposited
on the carbons to take a coat of solder.
Rinse each in hot water, and do the soldering
whilst the copper is new.

A special bath for copper-plating iron has been
recommended as under, but it is not thought to
have any advantage over the alkaline bath
already given. For use cold, the bath is made of
bisulphate of soda and cyanide of potassium, 18 oz.
each, carbonate of soda 36 oz., acetate of copper
17 oz., liquid ammonia 12-1/2 oz., and water 5-/12 gal.
If the bath is to be used warm, make it as follows:
Bisulphate of soda 7 oz., cyanide of potassium
25 oz., carbonate of soda and acetate of copper
18 oz. each, ammonia 10 oz., and water 5-1/2 gal.

So that copper can be electro-deposited on
terra-cotta, earthenware, etc., the surface of these
materials must be first rendered conductive to
electricity. This is done by coating with blacklead,
bronze powder, or some other finely divided
metal. Blacklead is brushed into the pores of the
material in a dry condition until the whole sur-

[Page.]

face is evenly coated and well polished. Bronze
powders are mixed with methylated spirit and
applied in the form of a paste. If the surface
is briskly brushed with a new brass-wire brush,
it wdll become coated with brass and thus made
conductive. A copper wire must then be tightly
twisted around some part of the article and
connected to the conductive surface by a liberal
application of the powder. Thus prepared, the
article is immersed in an electrotype solution,
connected to a battery or dynamo, and copper
deposited in the usual manner. Only a very thin
coat must be applied if the pattern is to be
retained or smoothness is desired. If the surface
of a flat object is only covered, this coating may
be afterwards peeled off; but if the object is
surrounded with copper, as a vase or statue, the
coat will be adherent.

In depositing a copper coating on a plaster
statue, coat the statue several times with linseed
oil or saturate with melted stearin to render the
plaster non-absorbent to the copper salts; these
would destroy the statue. When the surface is
dry and firm, apply a coat of paint made of bronze
powder mixed with methylated spirit only. Work
this into every crevice with a soft brush, and when
it is dry well brush every part with blacklead to
get a smooth surface. Brush with an alcoholic
solution of phosphorus, and then with an ammoniate
solution of silver, prepared by dissolving
silver nitrate to saturation in strong ammonia.
To ensure conduction to all parts of the statue,
several fine wires should be led to the deeper
crevices. A battery of Daniell cells should be
used, and deposition should proceed slowly to
obtain a smooth coat of copper.

The carved work, relief decorations, and other
enrichments of wooden doors, etc., may by
electro-plating be given a coat of copper, brass, nickel,
or other metal that will in certain circumstances

[Page.]

have a very rich appearance. Before plating, the
wood is preserved and prevented warping by being
coated with a good linseed oil varnish. When it
is varnished, metal strips as conductors are
fixed around the edges, and the whole surface is
rendered conductive by blackleading. A big
plating vat is required, and the operation of
depositing the metal is carried out as usual. The
excellent fire-resisting qualities of a wooden door
covered with tinplate are recognised, the metal
preventing the wood taking fire and the wood
framing preventing the door warping from the
heat and allowing flames to pass though, this last
being a defect of doors made wholly of iron. A
tinplate covered door has a poor appearance,
however, and is suitable only for workshops and
warehouses. An electrically deposited coat of metal
serves the same purpose as the tinplate, and the
process is suitable for doors in all situations.

The copper-plating of aluminium has many
difficulties. This metal cannot be nickel-plated,
as nickel must be deposited in an alkaline bath,
using ammonia and the salt ammonium sulphate,
and all alkaline salts rapidly corrode and
dissolve aluminium. So before nickel can be
deposited, the aluminium must be copper-plated,
and even this method is very troublesome, since
the small ingress of gas or a slight development of
hydrogen at the cathode, though very feeble and
perhaps scarcely visible to the naked eye, will be
a hindrance to the setting of the deposit. But if
a salt solution is used, the acid part of this will
not dissolve the aluminium, but it will oxidise any
hydrogen developed during operation in the
nascent state. The salt solution recommended is
nitrate of copper, whose effect can be further
enhanced by using an excess of nitric acid. A
solution of 100 grammes of sulphate of copper and 60
cubic centimetres of concentrated nitric acid of
specific gravity 1.3334 per 32 oz. of solution is

[Page.]

recommended. The aluminium must be first
roughened, preferably by sand-blasting (although
it may be roughened by rubbing with emery), and
then dipped in a weak solution of caustic soda or
potash until a considerable gassing takes place.
Next wash in concentrated nitric acid and place
in a copper bath. The copper anode should have
about the same surface as that of the article being
coppered. Constant moving either of the article
or solution is essential. Use current at a pressure
of about 4 volts, with a distance between the
electrodes of about 2 in. The opening and closing
of the circuit is made by dipping in and taking
out the objects. The length of time taken in
coppering will be from ten to twenty minutes.
Too thick deposits will strip off. When the
surface has been coppered, the article can be covered
with nickel in the usual way (see Chapter VII.).

The best method of plating aluminium is the
mechanical, not the electrical, one. The mechanical
method consists of laying over it a sheet of
clean nickel, fastening the two closely together,
and placing them between two large cast-iron
blocks previously heated to a dark red, a pressure
of 6-/12 tons to the square inch beng exerted on the
blocks, this pressure being applied gradually and
sustained for about fifteen minutes. The sweated
plate can now be rolled as an ordinary plate.

CHAPTER VI.

GOLD-PLATING.

Gold may easily be deposited in good condition
on a large variety of metals and alloys from a
solution of the double cyanide of gold and
potassium. This may be made and kept warm in an
enamelled iron saucepan over the flame of a
gas-burner or of an oil lamp, the saucepan serving as
the vat. One cell of any of the many suitable
varieties may be used, even one dry cell being
suitable. It is only necessary, therefore, to get
such a cell, and some gold solution heated to a
temperature of 160° F. in a saucepan, to connect
the trinket to be gilded by a length of No. 24
S.W.G. copper wire to the negative (zinc) pole of
the cell, and a strip of pure gold by a similar length
of wire to the positive (copper or carbon) pole of
the battery, and then to suspend both trinket and
gold in the hot solution for a few moments to coat
the trinket with gold.

A country jeweller often recognises the advantage
of the possession of a small plating outfit, if
only in the saving of time required in sending the
job to be done in town. Now, nearly all firms
supplying electro-platers' outfits and materials
for electro-platers also supply as a speciality a
small outfit suitable to the wants of watchmakers,
opticians, country jewellers, etc. The following
lists are selected from two catalogues, and these
will show the materials in general use for the
purpose. Canning and Co. supply the following:
One gilding vessel and portable stand complete;
1/2 gal. rich gold solution; one Bunsen burner and
tube; two 7-in. rectangular Bunsen batteries;

[Page.]

1 pt. sulphuric acid, or one tin of Canning's B or
negative battery powder; 2 pt. nitric acid, or
one tin of Canning's A or positive battery powder;
one sawdust pan and boxwood sawdust; one plate
brush; 1/2 lb. best rouge; 1 lb. mercury; one
amalgamating brush; 1 lb. No. 22 B.W.G. copper wire,
for connections; two hand scratch-brushes. For a
silver-plating plant they supply extra: one 1-gal.
enamelled vessel; 1 gal. of rich concentrated
silver solution; two rods, 10 in. long and 1/2 in. in
diameter; two connectors for the 1/2-in. rods. If
a coppering plant is also required, they supply an
extra enamelled iron vessel and 1 gal. of copper
solution, together with the necessary connecting
rods. It may be stated as a commentary on this
list, that the Bunsen battery charged with nitric
acid emits most acrid noxious fumes, and should
be kept in an outside shed or in a cupboard
ventilated into a chimney with a good up draught.
Covered bell wires of No. 20 S.W.G. may be
employed as conductors from the battery to the
plating vats. The Bunsen cells may also be
charged with other excitants which do not emit
such noxious fumes. The zinc elements in a
Bunsen battery whilst at work must be kept coated
with mercury, which, with a suitable brush to
apply it, is also provided. If the jeweller has not
a lathe which can be utilised, he should obtain
a combined scratch-brush and polishing lathe, with
assorted finishing mops and brushes.

J. E. Hartley and Sons supply the following
small outfits: Gilding outfit Q:--Enamelled iron
gilding vessel, with tripod stand and Bunsen burner
as shown by Fig. 61; one 6-in. Bunsen battery;
1 qt. gold solution; gold anode; 6 ft. of connecting
wire; and one hand scratch-brush. Gilding outfit
R:--Enamelled iron gilding vessel, tripod stand
and burner; one 8-in. Bunsen battery; 1 gal. gold
solution; gold anode; 6 ft. of connecting wire;
one hand scratch-brush of fine wire, and one of

[Page.]

medium wire. They also supply an optician's and
watchmaker's outfit, which comprises an enamelled
iron vessel (with stand) for the gilding solution as
above; 1 qt. gold solution and gold anode; also
suitable vessels for silver and for copper, with
1 gal. of silver solution and 1 gal. of copper
solution, together with silver and copper anodes;
also three 6-in. Bunsen batteries, 10 ft. of covered
connecting wires; wire for slings; three hand
scratch-brushes; three assorted scouring brushes;
2 lb. pumice; and 2 lb. whiting.

In a regular plating shop, the gilding vats are

[Fig. 61.--Small Gilding Outfit.]

generally of enamelled iron, mounted in iron
frames furnished with iron legs and heated with
Bunsen burners, as in the model outfits above
enumerated. In large establishments rectangular
vats hold from 10 to 30 gal. of gold solution, and
are fitted with steam jackets, as it is prejudicial
to health to have the vats heated by gas jets,
and with the use of the steam jackets the temperature
of the solutions can be regulated better.

The preparation of articles to be electro-gilded
is much the same as for those to be coated with
silver, with a few exceptions. It is not necessary
first to coat bright iron and steel with copper,
as gold may be firmly deposited in a hot solution
of the double cyanide of gold and potassium. But

[Page.]

it is advisable to copper-plate articles of zinc,
lead, pewter, and other soft alloys before they are
electro-gilded, because gold goes on them loosely.
Copper, silver, brass, German silver, and similar
hard metals with their alloys form suitable
materials for articles to be gilded. Gilding metal,
a kind of gunmetal, and the various kinds of brass
which are sold under grand names for sham
jewellery, all form excellent bases on which to
deposit gold, taking a very fine polish in their
preparation. The articles should always be highly
polished before they are gilded, this greatly
affecting the nature of the surface after gilding.

One method of producing a matt or frosted
appearance on gilded articles is to make the
surface rough by means of frosting brushes, by the
sand blast, or by the action of acid, before the
article is gilded.

It is not necessary in gold-plating to coat the
surface with meroury before gold is deposited on
it, except in the case when a very thick deposit
is required on bare copper.

The gilding solution can be made in one of
three ways.

(a) The best and the one chiefly used by professional
platers is composed of the double cyanide
of gold and potassium in distilled water. The
single cyanide of gold is a very light yellow
powder, 223 gr. containing 197 gr. of gold. This
is added to a strong solution of potassium cyanide
and stirred until dissolved, then made up to the
required strength with distilled water. The
strength varies from 5 gr. to 15 dwt. of gold in
the gallon, the richer quality being used where
large quantities of heavy gilding are done each
day, and the poor solution for merely blushing
the surfaces of trinkets with a gold tint.

(b) The solution may be made by dissolving gold
direct into a heated solution of potassium cyanide,
and passing an electric current through the solu-

[Page.]

tion from one strip of gold to another until
sufficient of the metal has been acquired. This
method is the most economical for small operations,
but as the solution thus made contains an
excess of potash, it is not to be recommended for
large operations.

(c) The solution may also be made by the
chemical method in a laboratory attached to the
workshop if the necessary skill is available, but
not otherwise, as unskilled attempts at making
cyanide of gold usually result in much loss of gold.
By the chemical method, the gold salt is precipitated
from its solution of gold terchloride by
cautiously adding a weak solution of potassium
cyanide; the resulting yellow powder is well
washed, and then dissolved in a strong solution of
potassium cyanide to form the gilding solution.
But, as the signs of complete precipitation are
not well defined, and as the single cyanide of gold
is so easily dissolved in a very slight excess of
potassium cyanide, there is danger of great loss
of gold in the making of the gilding solution by
this method.

Gold-plating solutions are generally heated for
use, and the repeated heating drives off the
solvent property of the solution; consequently, gas
having a noxious odour is given off, cyanogen
(prussic acid gas) is separated from the
potassium cyanide, and leaves potash alone in the
solution. As potash alone will not dissolve gold,
more of this precious metal is withdrawn from the
solution than is dissolved from the gold strip
(anode) to make up the loss. As a consequence,
the gilding becomes more and more poor in colour,
because the strength of the solvent has diminshed,
and the quantity of gold in the solution has also
decreased. Experienced electro-gilders add a
small quantity of potassium cyanide occasionally
to make up this loss, and also regulate the surface
of gold anode to the work in hand so as to prevent

[Page.]

impoverishment of the solution. The addition of
cyanide to a gilding solution must be made carefully
to avoid a great excess, as this will spoil
the colour of the gilding, giving it a foxy-brown
tint.

Pure gold (fine gold) must be employed in
making gilding solutions and for the anodes.
Coin gold and standard, or sterling, gold,
being alloys of gold with copper or silver,
should not be employed. If silver is present
in the gilding solution, the deposit will be
of a pale tint, grading to a greenish yellow with
each increase of silver. If copper is present in
the solution, the deposit will have a ruddy tint,
deepening to a reddish brown, and then to a dark
bronze with an increase of copper. The effect of
copper in deepening the tint of gold deposits has
been used in fancy jewellery, slight additions of
the inferior metal being made to the gilding bath
from time to time, and small copper anodes
employed to secure ruddy tints in the gilding; but
solutions thus alloyed require more skill to work
them successfully than those made of pure gold,
and are always more or less uncertain in their
action. The proportion of copper to gold is not
determined by the proportions of these metals in
the solutions and in the anodes, but by the
selective power of the current working the solution.
As this varies with the resistance of the circuit,
which alters with each variation in temperature
and change of metal to be gilded, so does the
proportion of the two metals, and the consequent
colour of the deposit.

The solution (b) described briefly on p. 104 is
recommended as being the cheapest and best for
the amateur gilder and the jeweller in a small
way of business. To prepare it, get 1 pt.
of distilled water, and 1/2 lb. of best 95 per
cent. cyanide of potassium. The latter is a deadly
poison, and will injure health even if handled with

[Page.]

the naked hand; it should be kept locked-up in
a wide-mouthed glass-stoppered bottle. Dissolve
2 oz. of the potassium cyanide in one pint of hot
distilled water, and place it in the vessel
intended to serve as a vat. Get two strips or plates
of pure gold, weighing from 7 to 10 dwt. each;
punch a small hole in the upper edge of each, and
hang each strip on a hook made of No. 20 platinum
wire. Hang one strip in the vat connected to
the wire leading from one pole of the battery (say,
the zinc plate), and the other strip of gold to the
wire leading from the other pole. See that the
gold dips only deep enough in the cyanide solution
just to touch the platinum hooks, but do not allow
the copper wires to hang in the solution. Copper
and gold will dissolve in cyanide solutions, but
platinum will not dissolve in them. The gold is to
be dissolved to make up a gilding solution, but
copper is not desired in the solution. If all has
been done right, an electric current will pass from
the zinc plates in the battery to the copper plates,
and from these along the wire to the gold strip in
the cyanide solution, through this, and back to
the battery by way of the other gold strip and the
wire leading to the zinc plate, thus completing
the electrical circuit. Whilst current is passing in
this way, gold will be dissolved off from the strip
of gold hanging to the wire leading from the
copper of the battery, and will be taken up by the
cyanide of potassium to form the double cyanide
of gold and potassium solution. Keep the solution
heated up to 160° F., and keep the battery
connected to it for one or two hours. At the end of
this time hang a German silver wire for a moment
or two in the vat, connected to the wire leading
from the zinc of the battery. If the wire takes
on a coat of a satisfactory character, hang both
strips of gold to the opposite wire, and call them
gold anodes, and connect the work to be gilded to
the cathode wire--that is, the wire from the zinc

[Page.]

of the battery. The action of the battery may be
carried on until 5 dwt. of gold has been dissolved
into the solution, or gilding may be begun
with only 1 dwt. of gold to the pint of solution.
The quantity of gold in the solution can always
be increased if the surface of the articles to be
gilded is less than the surface of the anodes, and
there is an excess of cyanide in the solution. The
contrary condition will result, of course, in an
impoverishment of the solution. A solution rich
in gold deposits a rich-looking coat of gold in a
short time, whilst one poor in gold works slowly,
and deposits a poor-looking coat.

A full battery of at least three Wollaston,
Smee, or Daniell cells, or two Bunsen cells, should
be used in making the gilding solution, but it can
be worked afterwards with a battery of one cell.
The Gassner or the Leclanche are both unsuitable
to use in making up the solution, but may be used
ia working it after it has been made up.

Gilding solution prepared by the chemical
method (see c, p. 105) will be found inferior to that
produced by method b, for though it will deposit
a coat of gold of a fairly good colour, the coat is
apt to strip off whilst being polished or burnished.
A further objection is the loss of gold involved.
This solution is best made up to the strength of
8 dwt. to thd gallon. To make it, proceed as
follows: Take 8 dwt. of fine gold and put it in a
porcelain dish of about 40 oz. capacity--an
enamelled saucepan will do if the dish is not
attainable--then pour upon this, gently, about
4 oz. of aqua regia, which is a mixture of 2 parts
of hydrochloric acid and 1 part of nitric acid.
Another aqua regia composition is 3 parts pure
hydrochloric acid, 1 part pure nitric acid, and 1
part distilled water. Gently heat the vessel
containing the gold and aqua regia over a Bunsen
burner to accelerate the chemical action, and when
the gold is dissolved, pour the resultant solution

[Page.]

of chloride of gold into another vessel and evaporate
the acid. If too much heat is used the gold
will be reduced to the metallic state; if this should
be the case, add a little more aqua regia to
re-dissolve, and then re-evaporate. When the acid
has been driven off, add to the resultant chloride
of gold about one pint of distilled water, or failing
this, use water that has been vigorously boiled and
filtered. If, when the chloride of gold is added to
the water, a white precipitate is formed, the chloride
of gold solution should be carefully decanted;
this precipitate is chloride of silver, which should
never, on any account, be allowed to get into the
gilding solution. To the solution of chloride of
gold, a strong solution of cyanide of potassium
should be added (this need not be of any specific
strength); a brown precipitate of cyanide of gold
is produced. The solution of cyanide should be
carefully added, so that a drop at last should
have no effect upon the clear solution. Too much
cyanide will re-dissolve the cyanide of gold. Allow
the solution to stand for about fifteen minutes,
pour the clear liquor off, and wash the precipitate
two or three times with distilled water. For this
purpose, a quantity of distilled water is poured
upon the precipitate; this is then allowed to settle
and the water run off; this is done two or three
times. When the cyanide of gold is sufficiently
washed, a solution of strong cyanide of potassium
is added to dissolve it. To the solution thus
produced, some more of the cyanide of potassium
solution is added to form free cyanide. Then add
sufficient distilled water to make up to one gallon.
This solution must be worked with a pure gold
anode, and a battery power of two Bunsens or
their equivalent, holding about a pint and a half
each. If the solution works a bit slowly, add a
little fresh cyanide. The solution must be worked
at a temperature of 125° to 135° F. A solution of
the same strength as above, and worked at a

[Page.]

temperature of 132° F. with two quart Bunsens,
has produced work of first-class colour, far better
than with other heats and strengths of solutions
and currents.

There is a number of other baths that may be
used, but those already given are the ones in
common employment. The following four baths
require the addition of one gallon of distilled
water, and are used hot. For use with iron and
steel, take bisulphite of soda, 2 oz.; crystals of
phosphate of soda, 8 oz.; pure potassium cyanide,
3/5 dr.; gold chloride, 160 gr. Dissolve the
phosphate of soda in a portion of the water heated.
In another portion of the water dissolve the
bisulphite and potassium cyanide, and in the
remainder of the water dissolve the gold chloride.
Stir the latter slowly into the phosphate solution
when cold, and then add the bisulphite and
cyanide solution. The bath should be heated to
about 180° F. A strong current is required.

For bronze and brass the following has been
used: Bisulphite of soda, 1-1/2 oz.; crystals of phosphate
of soda, 6-1/2 oz.; bicarbonate of potash, 3/4 oz.;
caustic soda, 3/4 oz.; pure potassium cyanide, 1/4 oz.;
gold chloride, 1/2 oz. Dissolve all, except the gold
chloride, in hot water. Then filter, and, when
cool, stir in the gold chloride, dissolved in water.
The bath should be heated to about 130° F.

A bath, which is simple in preparation, but
which cannot be recommended owing to the want
of uniformity in the results obtained, is made as
follows: Potassium cyanide, 3 oz. (nearly); gold
chloride, 1 oz. Dissolve the chloride in the gallon
of water mentioned above, and then stir in the
cyanide.

The following bath is for silver or copper
or similar alloys: Bisulphite of soda, 1-1/2 oz.;
crystals of phosphate of soda, 9-1/2 oz.; pure cyanide
of potassium, 1/6 oz.; gold chloride, 160 gr. This is
prepared in the same way as the bath for iron and

[Page.]

steel. The vessels containing the bath should be
of glass, porcelain, or enamelled iron. Before
electro-gilding lead, zinc, or tin articles, it is best
to give them a coat of silver. A bichromate battery
is preferable when using these hot baths.

Roseleur's cold gilding solution is made up of
fine gold, 10 parts; cyanide of potassium, 30 parts;
liquid ammonia, 50 parts; distilled water, 1,000
parts. The gold is converted into the terchloride
of gold, and this is dissolved in distilled water.
The liquid ammonia is added to this, and
fulminating gold is thrown down as a brown
precipitate. This precipitate is washed on a paper
filter, and dissolved at once with the cyanide of
potassium solution. The water is now added, and
the solution boiled for an hour to drive off excess
of ammonia. Care must be taken in making this
solution not to dry any of the precipitate, as it is
a dangerously explosive substance.

Another cold gold-plating bath is made with
pure potassium cyanide, 3-1/4 oz.; gold chloride,
3-1/8 oz. Dissolve the cyanide in part of the water
and the gold chloride in the remainder of the
water. Then add the latter solution to the first.
This solution should be boiled for about half an
hour before use.

Several attempts have been made, but without
success, to invent a cheap electro-gilding solution
for metal jewellery. Much, however, may be done
with copper anodes; these may be so worked in
the ordinary gold cyanide solution as slightly to
alloy the deposit of gold with copper, and thus give
a pleasing blush to a thin film of the precious
metal. The cheapest method of preparing these
solutions is to dissolve pure sheet gold in a
solution of potassium cyanide by means of current
from a battery until a test sample receives a nice
blush of gold in a few moments' treatment. The
articles must be clean and well polished, lightly
scratch-brushed, strung on wires attached to the

[Page.]

negative pole of the battery, and dipped for a
few moments in the gilding solution; then rinsed
in clean hot water, and brushed with a scratch-brush
of very fine, soft wire.

Alloyed gold may be deposited from an alloyed
solution of the double cyanide of gold and potassium,
but the process is not easily managed, and
the deposit not always certain. The following
process has been recommended: Dissolve 8 dwt. of
gold alloy in each gallon of solution containing
4 oz. of commercially pure cyanide by the usual
battery process. Work the solution at a temperature
of from 160° to 170° F., using the alloyed
anodes. If the colour is too dark, reduce the
density of the current. The colour of this alloyed
gilding has been found to vary with each slight
variation in current density brought about by a
different size of anode or of article being gilded,
or of slinging wire employed, or by a change in
the temperature of the solution.

Enough has now been said on the preparation
of the solution.

Fine soft copper wire should be employed to
connect the articles with the cathode rod of the
gilding vat, and the lengths of wire thus used are
named slinging wires. These may be inserted in
any holes in the articles, or twined round any
obscure projections, or formed into slings for the
suspension of coins and medals. In gilding some
patterns of long thin chains it is advisable to take
the chain in loops, and insert the wire in several
links, and if the chain is a bad conductor it will
be necessary to twine it around the slinging wire.
If this is not done, there will be patches of links
imperfectly gilded, or left ungilded.

Gold anodes should be made of pure gold plate
or ribbon, not less than 1/16 in. in thickness. Thin
gold leaf or sheet is apt to become ragged at the
edges as the anode gets worn; these ragged edges
drop tiny pieces of gold to the bottom of the

[Page.]

bath, and thus the solution, or the gilded goods,
gets credited with an undue portion of the wasted
anode. Plates of pure gold 1/16 in. in thickness
can be easily bent over a platinum wire, and this
forms the best support for the anode, since it is
not acted upon at all by the gilding solution or
its fumes. Copper, silver, or brass wires dissolve
and contaminate the solution with an alloy. If
alloyed gold is used for the anodes, the deposited
metal will soon become an alloy of gold instead
of pure gold; and the alloy is as likely to be as
variable in composition as most deposited alloys
are, and thus give trouble to the gilder. If gold
anodes have been hardened by hammering, they
should be annealed before being used. As a rule,
the surface of anode presented to the solution
should be slightly in excess of the surface to be
coated with gold. As anodes are more quickly
worn away at the surface of the solution, because
of the action of the air on them, they should be
lifted out when not in work, and their position
frequently changed.

The green slime on a gold anode when in a
plating solution is caused by an insufficiency of
free cyanide in the solution in proportion to the
other ingredients and the current employed. The
green slime may indicate a deficiency in gold
cyanide, and in this case much careful building up
of the solution will be necessary whilst small
quantities of cyanide are added. It may indicate
excess of current for the work in hand or a larger
anode surface than is necessary. Exhausted and
over-worked gold solutions are frequently indicated
by green slime on the anodes.

It might be supposed that because the gilding
solutions in general use are made with pure gold,
and because the anode plates also are of pure gold,
that the metal deposited would also be pure, and
of the same colour as the original gold. But this
is not always the case.

[Page.]

A newly made solution of the double cyanide of
gold and potassium invariably deposits a lemon-tinted
gold when worked under ordinary conditions.
As the solution ages, its deposit darkens,
until it resembles heavily alloyed gold. This
darkening is sometimes due to an accumulation
of copper dissolved from the slinging wires, and
from the articles that have been gilded in the
solution; but it may occur in solutions that have
been carefully protected, and is then due to
impurities contained in the added potassium cyanide,
and to an accumulation of free potash in the
solution.

The working temperature of an electro-gilding
solution ranges from 120° to 180° F. Within this
variation the temperature greatly affects the
colour of the deposit. Below 120° F. a pale
brassy-coloured deposit is obtained; from 120° F.
upwards the colour improves until 160° F. is
reached; then, as the internal resistance of the
bath is reduced, the gold goes on faster, and the
colour darkens.

Gold in good condition can be deposited with
a very feeble current, even from one cell of the
simplest battery. A very good deposit can be
obtained from a rich solution working at 1/2 volt,
with only a fraction of an ampere. If the solution
has but a small quantity of gold in it, the deposit
will be very pale, but may be darkened by
increasing the voltage. If the solution is in good
condition, this darkening disappears in 
scratch-brushing the deposit, but does not disappear if
the deposit is foxy, as when deposited from a
defective solution. Gold deposited fast, with a high
current density, soon assumes a brown tint, and
much of it is in a loose powdery condition; but
the brown appearance can be removed by brushing
the surface.

Gold can be deposited in good condition from
very weak solutions if attention be paid to their

[Page.]

temperature and to the current. With only a few
grams of gold per gallon of solution, a good colour
can be obtained when worked at a temperature
of 160° F. and from 1 to 2 volts. As the quantity
of gold per gallon is increased, the resistance of
the solution decreases, and gold is deposited
faster with the same voltage. This alters the
colour, though not to any great extent, in newly
made solutions; in fact, the colour indications
may deceive the worker, for heavy deposits at low
pressure from a rich solution may be very pale,
and thin deposits of a high colour may be obtained
from attenuated solutions worked at from 5 to 7
volts. As the density of the solution increases
owing to the accumulation of potash and
impurities, the colour of the deposited gold becomes
darker, and this high colour is permanent.

When a cyanide of gold solution is being
prepared, the worker adds a quantity of potassium
cyanide more than is required to dissolve the gold
cyanide, and this excess is named "free cyanide."
It dissolves the pure gold anode, and thus feeds
the solution with gold. If this is deficient, the
deposit will soon become pale, and have an
impoverished appearance. If it is excessive, the
colour of the deposit will be too high, and a great
excess will cause it to assume a foxy-brown tint,
which will be permanent, and not removable by
brushing.

When the electric current is too strong, a
silver-plating solution deposits its metal in the form
of a dirty grey loose powder, or the coat may have
the appearance of pewter. This is called
"burning" the work. When gold is deposited under
similar conditions, the deposit may vary in
appearance between a loose brown powder to a foxy
red, and from this to a dark bronze, resembling in
colour that of a dirty penny. Brown deposits of
gold may be improved by a judicious use of colouring
mixtures, but those of a foxy red and bronze

[Page.]

tint are usually intractable, and the workman will
find that they can only be restored by freshly
cleaning and re-gilding the article. As "burning"
is caused by too great a density of current
delivered at a high voltage, it may be avoided by
using a resistance board in circuit with the vat,
and throwing in sufficient resistance to stop back
the excess volume of current.

A very dark brown deposit of gold from an
electro-gilding bath may also be due to excessive
free cyanide and to a deficiency of gold in the
solution. This may be remedied by dissolving
more gold in the bath, or by adding cyanide of
gold until the excess cyanide of potassium has
been taken up.

The condition of the surface to be gilded affects
the colour of the gold deposited upon it. On bare
copper, the deposit has a nuldy tint; on a bare
silver surface, all thin deposits of gold have a pale
tint, the thinnest having a greenish-yellow hue.
Nickel and German silver surfaces impart a warm
tint to thin deposits of gold. Pale brass gives a
pale tint; but brasses and bronzes containing
higher percentages of copper, such as gilding
metal, impart a warm tint to thin deposits of gold.
A rough and dull copper surface will impart a
foxy-brown hue to thin deposits, whereas, if the
same copper article has its surface highly polished,
the deposit will have a warm, bright tint.

A matt or frosted surface on silver imparts a
pleasing yellow tint to a thin deposit of gold if
the minute silver points are clean and bright.
Another effect may be produced by depositing a
thin layer of gold on freshly deposited copper,
and still another by depositing gold on a thin
layer of freshly deposited silver. When the colour
is affected by the condition of surface, gold
deposits are rarely improved by scratch-brushing.

When gold solutions are alloyed with copper or
with silver, an alloyed deposit results; but its

[Page.]

colour cannot be predetermined by employing
anode plates of the desired alloy. The deposited
alloy does not always contain the same proportions
of the mixed metals as the anode plates.
This is due to the varying rates of deposit of the
metals employed. Pleasing effects may be obtained
by adding a small quantity of copper to a
gold solution, when a peculiar ruddy tint is
imparted to the gold deposit. Various pale shades
may also be obtained from a gold solution alloyed
with silver, a greenish deposit being thus
obtainable. Such gilding solutions are not suitable
for ordinary gilding work, and cannot be afterwards
restored to their former pure condition.

For gold-plating in colours there must be a
separate bath for each separate colour. For
green gilding add silver-plating solution to the
gilding solution in very small quantities at a time
until the required tint has been obtained; too
much silver solution will cause a whitish deposit,
known as white gold. To gild red, add a solution
of copper cyanide, or use a copper anode
until the desired colour is deposited. To gild rose
pink, first gild the article and scratch-brush it,
then deposit a mere flash of silver on the surface;
on this deposit a mere tint of copper from an
alkaline copper bath, and then just a blush of gold
l<> tint the copper. The process is a delicate one.

A thick deposit of gold is obtained in the
following manner: The articles are frequently taken
from the gilding bath and scratch-brushed to
remove the brownish appearance, then rinsed and
returned to the bath. If this is not done the gold
will not adhere, but will simply surround the
article in the form of brown mud, and this
condition is soon observed when the solution is poor,
and when the current is too strong.

Highly polished small steel articles, free from
grease and oil, may be gilded in an electro-gilding
solution of gold cyanide. When a quantity of

[Page.]

such articles is to be gilded, they may be done in
dozens at a time if suspended in the solution in a
basket of platinum gauze; this basket must be
shaken whilst the gilding process is going on.
Any gold deposited on the platinum may be afterwards
dissolved off in the gilding solution without
doing it any injury. The steel articles are
scratch-brushed and polished in the usual manner.

Articles made of aluminium cannot be gilded
direct in a solution of the double cyanide of gold
and potassium, because the alkali therein attacks
and rapidly dissolves the aluminium. They should
therefore be first coated with copper in a solution
of copper sulphate, and then transferred to
the gilding bath.

The insides of mugs, spoons, salt cellars, etc.,
are gilded by means of a special arrangement
in which the articles are connected to the cathode
system; then they are filled with gilding solution,
and gold is deposited from a gold anode held in
the solution by hand. If the vessel will hold any
gold solution, fill it and connect it with the
negative pole of the battery or dynamo, and for an
anode use a strip of gold on the end of a wire
connected to the positive pole. The anode is held
in the gilding solution contained in the vessel, or
moved about in it as required. If the vessel will
not hold liquid, it may be gilded with a rag mop
wrapped around the anode and repeatedly dipped
in the gilding solution, connection being made
with the battery as before.

The scratch-brushes used in brushing gilded
work are made with very fine brass wire, some
being crimped for extra elasticity combined with
softness. Special shapes are required for such
goods as rings and watch cases, so that the
insides may be brushed and polished. Sometimes a
good brushing with a scratch-brush is all the
finish required for the insides of goods. When
chains are heavily gilt, each link must be twisted

[Page.]

around and brushed, whilst only a short length
of chain is held between the fingers and thumbs of
both hands.

Gilt articles are polished on soft mops made
of swansdown, soft felt, and chamois leather,
using finest rouge composition as the polishing
material. The insides of rings are polished on
felt fingers so tapered as to fit any size of ring.
Chains are polished on broad-shaped bobs covered
with soft leather on the convex sides. Thimbles
and similar hollow ware have specially formed
bobs made with wooden stocks of the required
shape covered with fine soft felt.

Contrasts in the various grades of finish are
sometimes resorted to for effect. A frosted
appearance is secured by using a coarse
scratch-brush having long bunches sparsely set in the
boss, and holding a stick to the revolving brush
just before it strikes the gilded articles. Raised
parts are burnished with suitable burnishers made
of steel, bloodstone, and agate. A final yellow
blush is often imparted by a momentary dip in a
new gilding solution, after which the article is
rinsed in hot water and dried.

Gold is deposited rapidly from ordinary
electro-gilding solutions, and a sufficiently strong
coat may be deposited in the course of a few minutes,
the rate being about 37 gr. an hour per
ampere. Weigh the articles after they have been
cleaned and after they have been gilded to ascertain
the quantity of gold on them. When, therefore,
by calculation of time and current, it has
been estimated that enough gold is deposited, the
article must be rinsed in clean water,
scratch-brushed to remove the brown appearance,
dried by rubbing in sawdust or otherwise, and then
weighed. If there is not enough gold on the
article, return it to the gilding bath.

Professionally, the weight of gold and silver
deposited is according to the charge to be made

[Page.]

for the job. The article should therefore be
weighed in a balance when it has been dry-finished
for plating, and the weight entered in a book.
If it is a ring, for instance, weighing 50 gr.,
and the price will allow of 2 gr. of gold being
put on, it is immersed in the gilding solution for
a few minutes, then rinsed, scratch-brushed, and
dried, and again weighed. If it weighs 51 gr.,
it must be again put into the gilding solution for
a few minutes, and the foregoing process repeated
until it weighs 52 gr. The price per grain is
easily ascertained by dividing the price of pure
gold per ounce by 480, the number of grains in an
ounce. Silver is reckoned by the pennyweight,
taking 1/2 dwt. as the lowest fraction. To the cost
of metal must be added the cost of labour in preparing
and finishing, and a small addition to cover
the cost of deposition. This gives the prime cost.

In gilding lockets, light brooches, and similar
light trinkets, the solution will get inside and
remain there during the process of scratch-brushing.
This must be taken into consideration when weighing
the goods, and care must be taken to have
them dry. Some of the hollow ware is filled with
a waxy composition which oozes out in the course
of gilding, and this falsifies the calculations made
to determine the deposit of gold.

The amateur and small professional plater are
interested more in the gilding of such trinkets
as brooches, chains, coins, rings, etc., than in larger
and more ambitious work; so it is proposed here
to treat this branch of the gilder's art in greater
detail. A brass ring could be taken from a man's
finger, and, seeing that it is bright and clean, a
person might conclude it would not need cleaning
before hanging it in the gilding bath. Assume it
to be merely wiped with a scrap of rag, a bit of
copper wire tied to it, and hung in the gilding
bath. In a few moments it receives a coat of gold
all over, and may be rinsed in warm water to free

[Page.]

it from the cyanide salts, wiped dry with a rag,
and handed back to the owner, gilded. The ring
looks fairly well, but by rubbing it with the palm
of the hand the very thin coat of gold can be
removed in a few moments, leaving the brass bare.
All trinkets may be thinly gilt in a similar manner,
and the thin coat of gold can be as easily rubbed
off. If the ring is left in the gold bath for a few
minutes, it will take on a brown coat instead of a
golden tint. This brown coat is merely the matt
appearance assumed by electro-deposited gold,
and this will entirely disappear on brushing the
coat with a brush of fine brass wire kept
lubricated with stale beer. But on brushing in this
way an imperfectly cleaned ring as it comes from
a person's finger, the ring assumes a brassy
appearance, because the gold went on loosely over
the sweaty parts of the ring, and these loose
particles of gold are readily detached from the
imperfectly cleaned spots by the wire brush, and
this non-adherence of electro-deposited coats
becomes more apparent with thick coats than with
thin ones. To get a perfectly adherent coat of
electro-deposited metal, the article must be
thoroughly cleaned. Let it appear to be ever so
clean to the eye, it must have contracted a trace
of animal grease, or sweat, if it has been handled
or worn, and this film of animal matter must be
taken off in a solution of strong alkali, such as
soda, potash, or ammonia, before a coat of
adherent metal can be deposited on the article. A
strong solution of washing soda may be used if
nothing better can be obtained. Pearlash is a
better cleanser; American pearlash, or potash, is
still stronger; and the best cleansers (in general
use by professional platers) are commercial caustic
soda and caustic potash. A piece of either of
these, about the size of a walnut, dissolved in half
a pint of hot water, will be enough to clean a
dozen or two of small trinkets or chains. First

[Page.]

dissolve the potash or soda in hot water, then
string a few trinkets on about 6 in. of No. 20 or
No. 22 copper wire, and swill the bunch for a few
minutes in the hot liquor. Transfer from the hot
caustic solution to some clean warm water, and
well rinse the trinkets in this to clear off the
loosened grease. When the caustic liquid is cool,
put it in a closely stoppered bottle to exclude the
air, and thus preserve it for future use. After the
grease has been loosened, if there is no corrosion
on the article, it must be briskly brushed with a
little whiting, or prepared chalk, or finely
powdered pumice, again rinsed, and then hung in the
gilding solution.

If the trinkets are corroded, the corrosion
must be removed in a pickle made of two parts
sulphuric acid, two parts water, and one part
nitric acid, after which the articles must be rinsed
in clean water.

Chains of a strong pattern may be rolled up
in a mass between the two hands with a little
whiting, and rubbed until polished; but those of
more delicate construction may not be treated in
this way, but must be carefully brushed. Filigree
work will require very careful treatment in cleaning,
and the gold should be deposited on it with
low battery power, to prevent browning the
deposit, since it cannot be well brushed bright
afterwards. Long chains of a delicate pattern should
be threaded on a long thin copper wire passed
through the links at intervals of from 2 in. to 3 in.,
or the wire should be wound spirally around the
chain, to assist in conducting the current to all
parts equally.

Ear-rings and brooch pendants made of metal
beads strung on silk should be suspended in a
small basket of platinum gauze, in order that the
beads may be placed in connection with a conductor
of electricity, since silk will not conduct the
electric current. Such goods should not be put

[Page.]

in the caustic solution, as this will dissolve silk,
and cause the beads to drop off. All trinkets
containing hair, photos, and other material likely
to be injured by the hot gilding solution, must
not be put in the caustic solution until the hair,
photo, etc., has been removed. It is also
advisable to remove glass and stones liable to injury
from this cause, and to re-set them when the work
is finished. Trinkets made of aluminium only will
not receive a coat of gold, but will dissolve in
caustic solution and in the gilding solution (see
p. 118). The brush used in brushing articles before
gilding may be an old, but clean, tooth-brush, or
any clean brush with stiff bristles.

Special care must be taken with common jewellery.
Bits of coloured glass, called "stones," are
inserted in cheap brooches, rings, etc., under the
names of rubies, diamonds, pearls, etc. In the
commonest goods these stones are merely attached
with gum or some soluble cement, which is dissolved
in the solution, and thus the stones come
off. An examination of the goods before gilding
will soon detect these, and, if the "stones" are
not held firmly in claws, they should be taken out
by steeping the articles in hot water before they
are prepared for gilding. They must be re-set
after the goods are gilded.

Whilst preparing the trinkets, the condition of
their surface must be noted. If this is scratched,
dented, bruised, or pitted with corrosion, the
marks cannot be obliterated by polishing and
burnishing after gilding. All such blemishes must be
removed before the articles are cleaned, if they
are to be removed at all, and this can only be
done by hand, either by pressing out the dents
with suitable pieces of wood, or removing the
scratches with a fine file and burnishing the filed
spot. All repairs must be done first, as it will
be difficult to repair electro-gilt goods when
finished.

[Page.]

Joints made with soft solder are difficult to coat
with gold, but small joints may be doctored up
by rubbing over them a wet piece of bluestone
(sulphate of copper) and then touching the place
with a piece of bright iron or steel. Both the
iron and the joint will take on a coat of copper
and cover the solder. Rinse the joint in clean
water, and hang the article in the gilding solution.

If there are several soldered joints or much soft
solder about the trinket, or if it is desired to coat
a pewter medal, lead casting, zinc ornament, piece
of tinned iron, or article composed wholly or
partly of iron, tin, lead, or zinc, it is advisable
first to coat it with copper in an alkaline coppering
solution, made up as described on p. 76. At
least three battery cells will be needed to deposit
copper from this solution, and perhaps four cells,
arranged in series, may be required to force the
copper on a soldered joint; but the copper thus
deposited will be firm and adherent, and may be
well polished. Use a piece of good copper, such
as electrotype copper, as an anode. A mere film
of copper is all that is required to protect the
article from the action of the gilding solution.
If the film does not go on evenly in a few minutes,
take the article out of the bath, briskly brush
it with a brass wire brush, and return it to the
coppering solution. This solution may be worked
cold or hot, as may be desired; but the deposit
is brighter from a hot solution than from a cold
one. This solution is also useful to give an
18-carat gold appearance to gilded or pure gold
goods. This is done by merely flashing a film
of copper over the surface when finished, then
flashing a film of gold on this, rinsing at once in
hot water, and drying off in clean sawdust. By
careful working in this way, a clever workman can
get any desired tint of gold on the surface.

CHAPTER VII.

NICKEL-PLATING AND CYCLE-PLATING.

To facilitate the reader's mastery of the information
about to be presented, it may be said that
this chapter conforms to the following arrangement:

The nickel-plater's and cycle-plater's plant;
the necessary solutions; the preparation of
the work; the preliminary coppering of cycle
parts; the actual process of nickel-plating; the
finishing of nickel-plated work; re-plating; the
working of nickel-plating solutions in general;
and special applications of nickel-plating.

In the cycle trade large firms have a plating
shop as a branch of their business; but small
repairers are content to send their work to
professional platers, though, as business increases,
they naturally wish to do all the work on their own
premises, and so save time and intermediate
profits. To this end they seek to do the plating
at home, and they look about them for the
information necessary to guide them in laying down
a plating plant. This chapter is intended as an
aid to tradesmen desirous of expanding their
business in this way, but the information given
will be of value to all who are interested in
electro-plating.

The cycle maker's nickel and copper plating
outfit, supplied by Messrs. J. E. Hartley & Son of
Birmingham, at £44, includes the following
appliances and materials:--

	- Shunt-wound dynamo (4-1/2 volts, 40 amperes,
	3-1/2 in. pulley, speed, 1,700 revolutions per
	minute).

[Page.]

	- Resistance board for regulating current.
	- Plating vat (6 ft. by 2 ft. by 1 ft. 6 in.),
	lead-lined, burnt joints, bolted and
	match-boarded.
	- Salts for making 100 gal, of nickel solution.
	Twelve nickel anodes (total weight 31 lb.)
	and hooks.
	- Cable, three rods, five connections, and
	copper wire. Wrought-iron, potash, and hot-water tanks
	--the latter galvanised.
	- Galvanised wrought-iron sawdust pan.
	- Lead-lined scouring trough and twelve
	assorted scouring brushes.
	- 28 lb. of potash, bag of boxwood sawdust,
	and 28 lb. of pumice powder.

A dynamo of 5 volts and 80 amperes, the pulley
diameter being 3-1/2 in. and the speed 1,100
revolutions per minute, is supplied in the place of
the dynamo mentioned above at an extra cost of £6.

To the above plant must be added the following
items, costing £ll, if coppering is to be
undertaken:--

	- Resistance board.
	- Vat, 4ft. by 2 ft. by 1 ft. 6 in.
	- Chemicals for making 50 gal. of copper
	solution.
	- Four copper anodes and hooks.
	- Three rods and connections.
	- Twaddell hydrometer.
	- Five pounds of cyanide of potassium.

The output of such a plant (with the larger
dynamo) if under the control of an efficient plater
is estimated at 100 sets of cycle fittings per week.

A nickel-plating outfit suitable for repairers,
etc., is priced at £36; it has an output of 40 sets
of cycle fittings per week, and differs from the
£44 nickeling plant already specified in having
a vat measuring 4 ft. by 2 ft. by 1 ft. 6 in., eight
anodes, and smaller quantities of chemicals and

[Page.]

materials, no coppering appliances and materials
being included.

Similar outfits are supplied by other makers,
whose lists should be obtained.

The above will be found sufficient for those
who have facilities for preparing and polishing the
cycle fittings, but if unprovided with a good
polishing lathe and its accessories, the cost of this
must be added, since nothing can be well done
without it.

If a battery of large Bunsen cells is employed
instead of a small dynamo, the total cost will be
a few pounds less; but a battery is not advised if
power can be obtained for driving the dynamos.
Batteries are messy, and the daily work of keeping
them in order is something considerable, whilst
the cost of their maintenance is a very serious
item. To compete with professional platers, it is
necessary to have polishing lathes driven by
steam, water, gas, or some similar power, and the
same source of power can be used for driving the
dynamos.

Directions are sometimes given for making
nickel-plating solution by dissolving grain nickel
in acid. As these home-made salts are inferior to
those obtainable from a good dealer in nickel-plating
outfits, and the quality of a nickel deposit
largely depends on the purity of the salts used in
making the solution, intending platers are advised
to purchase the salt direct, instead of attempting
to make it in the workshop.

The salt of nickel in general use for making
nickel-plating solutions is the double sulphate
of nickel and ammonia. This is a beautiful clear
sea-green salt when pure, and takes the form of
crystals, ranging in size from that of peas to that
of chestnuts. The salt is merely dissolved in
boiling water in the proportion of 1 lb. to each
gallon, and poured into the vat when cool. Fairly
good solutions may be made with 12 oz. of nickel

[Page.]

salt to the gallon; but weak solutions offer a
high resistance to the current, and the deposit
is liable to be powdery and loose. Rainwater is
preferable to spring-water in making the solution,
and it is advisable to pass it through a calico
filter into the vat, to remove any loose dirt
accidentally acquired by the nickel salt. If best
nickel salt is used, it will not be necessary to add
either ammonia or table salt, these being
employed to correct some fault in old and poor
solutions.

If for some special reason it is desired to make
the. double salt of nickel and ammonia at home,
proceed as follows: Take of nickel 14 oz., dissolve
it in a mixture of three parts of strong
nitric acid, one part of strong sulphuric acid, and
four parts water. When dissolved, which is indicated
by the fumes (caused by chemical action)
ceasing, add a little hot water and filter; the deep
green liquid obtained is a strong solution of nickel
sulphate. Then make up a strong solution of
ammonium sulphate by dissolving 4 lb. of the salt
in a gallon of water. For preparing the plating
solution mix about half of ammonium sulphate
solution with the sulphate of nickel, and make up
with water to one gallon.

In working nickel solutions, they become too
acid when insufficient anode surface has been
provided. To correct this excess acidity, add liquor
ammonia in small quantities until the solution
ceases to redden blue litmus paper. When a solution
ceases to deposit white nickel, a very small
quantity of common salt is added, say 1/6 oz. to the
gallon of solution.

Messrs. Hartley point out that if the nickel
solution be weak, it offers too much resistance to
the flow of the current; whilst if it is too acid,
the deposit is pulverulent and peels off. The
brilliant whiteness of American nickel plating is
due mainly to the quality and purity of the salts

[Page.]

used. A slightly acid bath is best for iron, this
giving a beautiful white deposit, whereas an
alkaline or neutral solution gives a darker shade.
A yellow sediment in the plating solution is due to
the bath being too alkaline.

Litmus paper for testing the solution should be
kept handy; an acid solution turns blue litmus
to red; an alkaline solution turns red litmus to
blue. The use of cast nickel anodes soon causes
a bath to become alkaline.

A form of hydrometer with a heavily loaded
bulb at the bottom can be used if desired for
testing a nickel-plating solution, the instrument
being appropriately termed a nickelometer. To
test a solution pour a quantity into a testing glass
(any long, slender glass vessel will do) and gently
lower the instrument into the sample. The nickelometer
has a graduated stem, and the nickel solution
should not register less than seven degrees on
this. If it does, more nickel salts must be added
until the density of the solution is correct.

Nickel anodes should invariably be made of
pure rolled nickel plates of a thickness suitable
to the work in hand. Small anodes for small
operations should be thin, the thickness increasing
with the superficial size of anode required.
Plates of cast nickel are always clumsy, because
heavy and thick; they are also brittle and porous,
whilst the pores are apt to contain impurities.
Loose carbon, in the form of graphite, has been
found interspersed with badly cast nickel.
Rolled-nickel anodes give off the metal constantly and
steadily; they do not become soft or fall to pieces
while in the bath as cast-nickel anodes do; they
may be light and thin to begin with, and they last
a long time. Anodes of nickel may be suspended
from strong hooks of copper, inserted in holes
punched or drilled in the nickel plates. A suitable
hook is illustrated by Fig. 5 (p. 19), but
Messrs. Canning and Co. offer the hook shown by

[Page.]

Fig. 62 as an improvement. This slides along the
rods, and is very secure.

It is advisable to coat all cycle fittings with
copper before placing them in the nickel-plating
vat. Copper will adhere firmly to all metals if
properly deposited, and fill in all cracks and
blemishes, whilst nickel will adhere well to copper.
It therefore performs the part of a solder in
uniting nickel to other metals. Nickel may be
deposited firmly on iron and steel without the help
of copper, but the process demands more skill, and

[Fig. 62. Improved Hook for Nickel Anode.]

the beginner does not produce such
good results as when a coat of copper
is first deposited on the fittings. The
matter is fully discussed on pp. 90
to 92. Copper may be readily deposited
on iron and steel from an acid
solution of sulphate of copper, but
the deposit of copper thus obtained
will be useless for the present
purpose, because it will not adhere
firmly to the plated articles. When
copper is deposited on iron and steel
from an alkaline solution of copper,
the deposit has a fine grain, and is
firmly adherent to the article. The
best alkaline solution for cycle
plating is made as follows:--Estimate
1/2 lb. of copper sulphate for
each gallon of solution required, and dissolve
this salt in enough hot rainwater to form a
solution. This will be about half a gallon of
water to each pound of salt. Set this aside to
cool, and when cold, add enough liquid ammonia,
whilst stirring with a stick, first to throw down
the copper in the form of green mud, and then
dissolve this to form a beautiful blue liquid, free
from sediment. Add to this enough cyanide of
potassium dissolved in rainwater to destroy all
the fine blue colour, and give the colour of old

[Page.]

ale to the solution. The quantity of liquid
ammonia and of cyanide of potassium cannot be
definitely stated here, as these materials vary
very much in strength and quality; hence, it is
safest to follow the above colour indications,
being careful to stir the solutions well after each
addition of ammonia and of cyanide.

For purposes of estimation take equal weights
of each salt and the ammonia, as both are used
for other purposes, if there should be a surplus.
The solution thus formed should be well stirred,
allowed to rest for a night, and then filtered
through calico into the vat, where it is made up
to the required quantity with rainwater.

The coppering vat must be furnished with rods,
anodes, cables, resistance-board, and other
fittings, as before mentioned.

In preparing new work intended to be plated,
the work of the smith and fitter may be found
either a help or a hindrance to the polisher and
plater. Rough forgings, weldings, and brazings
by an unskilled or careless smith cause an immense
amount of extra labour to the plater's polisher.
It may be stated emphatically here that all
notions respecting the filling up and covering over
properties of nickel are entirely erroneous and
false. Nickel will not fill up cracks and deep pits,
cuts, or file marks; it will not cover defective
forgings and rough welds. If the fitter does not
file these out, they will be shown in the finished
work, unless the polisher grinds out the flaws on
the emery-wheel, and thereby weakens the part;
thus a defective machine is the result of a
polisher's attempt to make good the faults of the
smith. The smith should therefore aim at turning
out his part of the work in as smooth and
finished condition as he can. The fitter should
also be careful to avoid bruising or denting the
surfaces of the parts, and leaving rough file-marks
on them. He also should aim at turning out the

[Page.]

machine in a finished condition, remembering that
the polisher's duty is to put on a higher finish,
but not to make good the fitter's defects.

The preparatory polishing of iron and steel
parts of cycles may be done by hand with different
grades of emery-cloth, but the work is best done
in a polishing lathe or on an emery tape machine
(see Chapter III.). When it is known that the
surfaces of parts to be nickel-plated must be made
as smooth and bright as iron and steel can be
made before they are plated, the use of a machine
to do this will be appreciated. The smallest
scratch left by the smoothing file, or even by fine
emery-cloth, will be plainly visible in the nickel
coat even when this has been polished, for nickel
is too hard and intractable to be scratch-brushed
and burnished like copper, silver, or brass.

If the forgings are rough, the rough parts
must be taken down on an emery-wheel fastened
to the spindle of the polishing lathe between
suitable collars. Some skill is required in the
use of these powerful tools, as they soon grind
and cut their way into wrought-iron. The work
must therefore be kept well alive in front of the
wheel, and not allowed to lie long enough for the
emery to cut into the metal. Different shapes
and sizes may be necessary to suit different forms
of parts.

When the rough patches are reduced, the work
must next be submitted to the action of an
emery-bob. If the work is not very rough, an
emery-bob may be used from the first. For cycle work
it is advisable to have an assortment of bobs,
varying from 12 in. in diameter down to 9 in.,
6 in., and 4 in., and in various thicknesses, from
2 in. to 1 in.; also some solid bobs made of
bull-neck or sea-horse, some of them only 1/2 in. in
thickness, and turned round on their edges to fit
curves and hollows (see Fig. 34, p. 65). Coarse

[Page.]

grain emery, such as No. 90, is used on bobs
intended for the first grinding, then No. 120, or a
finer grade, to take out marks made by the first;
then the work must be finished off or "coloured"
with flour-emery on a plain uncoated bob. The
flour-emery must be mixed with a little oil, just
enough to keep it from flying about, and allowed
to pass between the work and the bob whilst this
is revolving.

The bobs are made to revolve toward the
workman, who stands in front, a little on one side,
and holds the work to the revolving bob. The
work must be kept well alive whilst polishing--
that is, must be kept in continual movement,
either from side to side or round and round in
front of the bob, to prevent lines from being cut
in the metal. It is somewhat difficult to guide a
novice by instructions on paper, for there are
many little acquired knacks known only to the
practical polisher, and called up on the spur of
the moment to meet some little requirement;
these knacks can only be obtained by practice.
Polishing metal is generally designated dirty
work, and the workman should protect his clothes
by wearing a canvas apron or blouse overall;
but he may avoid much dirt by standing a little out
of the line of particles flying off from the bobs.

Copper, German silver, brass, and alloys of
soft metals are not prepared with emery, but with
a fine sand, sold under the name of Trent sand,
applied on a clean bob. When the rough surface
has been worn down with this sand, it is next
subjected to the action of Tripoli composition
applied by a calico mop run on the spindle of the
polishing lathe. Tripoli composition is a
composition of Tripoli powder and tallow, and is sold
in three grades--A, a fine grade for polishing
nickel-plated goods, and putting the finishing
polish on German silver, brass, copper, and other
soft metals; B is a grade not so fine as the pre-

[Page.]

ceding, but will do for the same purpose where
a highly-finished surface is not desired; H is a
harder and rougher grade, very useful in taking
scratches and file-marks out of brass and copper
before using the finer grades. These compositions
are superior in every way to loose powder for
polishing purposes.

Surfaces about to be nickel-plated are given
the finishing touch with a 9-in. calico mop charged
wdth rouge composition, or with rouge powder
mixed with water, or with fine powdered lime
specially prepared for the purpose, and sold under
the name of Sheffield lime.

When the articles to be plated leave the polisher's
hands, they are apparently as clean as it is
possible to make them; not a spot can be seen
on the surface, which is clear and bright as a
mirror. But this mirror-like surface will not
receive a coat of nickel, or, strictly speaking, will
not retain the coat even should the plater get it
on the article. This surface is coated with a very
thin transparent film of animal matter, such as
grease or oil, although it may have been finished
with rouge and water or wdth lime, and this film
will be quite enough to prevent the coat of nickel
from uniting with the surface of the metal. Even
one little spot in an obscure angle untouched by
the scourer, will take on a loose coat of nickel,
and form a blister, which will strip in the finish
polishing, or after the article has been in wear for
a few days.

When the articles leave the polisher, they must
therefore be first soaked in the hot potash
solution, to loosen and saponise the film of grease
contracted whilst being polished, then rinsed in
hot water to remove any loose soap and potash,
and passed on to the scouring trough. A hold
may be maintained on them during the dipping
and rinsing processes by first twisting a stout wire,
or two wires, if necessary, around them. Nuts,

[Page.]

collars, rings, and similar articles with holes in
them, may be strung on wires, but it is not
advisable to bunch too many, as they are liable to
scratch whilst being rinsed.

The work to be scoured is held by the workman
in his left hand on the edge of the scouring tray,
or on a board provided for the purpose, whilst
he scours it all over with a brush dipped in
finely-powdered pumice-stone or finely-powdered
whiting. Whiting is to be preferred, because it is not
so rough as powdered pumice. Some workmen
peg pieces of buff leather to the edges of the
trays and scouring boards, to prevent scratching
by the wood. Be sure to scour every little crevice
of the article, and leave no part untouched, for it
will be just this unscoured part which will strip
after being plated. The work requires merely a
brisk light brushing. Keep the left hand well
coated with whiting, or handle the work with a
clean linen rag to prevent soiling by sweat, for
this will cause the nickel coat to strip.

When every part has been well scoured, attach
the slinging wires to each article as it is finished,
rinse off all the whiting in one division of the
trough, then in clean water contained in the next
division, then in the hydrochloric dip for a few
moments, again in clean water, and transfer at
once to the copper-plating vat to receive a coat
of copper, after which rinse and place in the
nickel-plating vat.

After the articles are scoured and rinsed--if
made of iron, steel, zinc, Britannia metal, or
pewter, and if the work of scouring has been
done speedily--they may be transferred at once
to the coppering vat. Whilst scouring large
articles made of iron and steel, it is almost
impossible to prevent some parts from contracting
a thin film of rust; and this, if left on, would spoil
the work by preventing close adherence of the
deposited coat. It is therefore advisable to dip

[Page.]

them for an instant in a solution of hydrochloric
acid to remove the film of oxide thus contracted,
then rinse them before placing them in the
coppering vat. The vessel to contain this solution
may be made of wood lined with lead, similar in
all respects to the plating vat already described.
The solution is composed of 1 part commercial
hydrochloric acid (spirits of salts) in 5 parts of
water.

While brass, German silver, gun-metal, and
similar alloys are being scoured, they also are
liable to become tarnished on exposure to the air.
It is therefore advisable to dip them in a solution
of cyanide of potassium before placing them in
the plating vat. There are not many or very
large articles made for cycles in these metals, and
so a small stoneware vessel will hold all the
solution required for this purpose. The solution
contains 1/2 lb. of commercial cyanide of potassium
in each gallon of water. The cleaned articles are
first swilled for a minute or two in this dip, then
rinsed, and transferred at once to the plating vat.
Copper must be treated in a similar manner.

Lead alloys, such as pewter, Britannia metal,
etc., are but seldom if ever used in the cycle
trade; when they are used, they are rinsed in the
potash tank, and transferred from this direct to
the coppering vat.

The dynamo must be going, and the vat already
connected with it, before the articles are
suspended in the nickel solution, for no time must
be lost in starting the deposit after the final
rinsing. Wherever practicable, each article should
be suspended in the bath, so as to have the same
quantity of solution above and below it--that is
to say, it must be well below the surface, but not
touching the bottom or the sides of the vat. It
should also be slung with its surface facing two
rows of anode plates--that is, with the nickel
anodes all round, but not too close to the article.

[Page.]

The switch on the resistance board should be well
over, to include a high resistance when the first
article is placed in the vat, then moved to a lower
resistance when more articles are put in, because
then more current is required. Put in large
articles first, then sling smaller articles, such as
nuts, collars, and screws, between them. If this
order is not observed, the smaller things may
strip whilst being polished. Steel should thus be
flanked with iron, but it is not desirable to
attempt plating copper, brass, German silver, and
like alloys in a vat with iron and steel. These
are best done by themselves. Small goods, when
wired together, should have quite 1/4 in. of space
between each article, and screws are best wired
with fine copper wire twisted around each, to form
a long string of them.

The work of deposition must go on without
interruption for a period of from 1-1/2 to 3 hours,
according to the class of work to be done. It is
sometimes necessary to turn the articles and move
the slinging wires to prevent marking by the
wires, but the goods should not be taken out of
the solution.

When the article has been in the nickel-plating
solution long enough to acquire the desired thickness
of nickel, it is lifted out of the solution by
means of the slinging wires, rinsed at once in the
hot water tank, and immediately placed in the hot
sawdust pan to dry off quickly. This celerity is
necessary to prevent unsightly blotches and spots
on the nickel-plated surface, as these show after
the work has been polished. When a good deposit
of nickel comes out of the vat, it has a
creamy white or a dull grey appearance, which
passes to a creamy white when rinsed in hot
water. Nickel deposited too fast or from an
inferior solution may have a dirty grey appearance,
which does not alter very much even when rinsed
in hot water. To remedy this, add from one to

[Page.]

two per cent, of common salt (sodium chloride)
to the solution, and stir well together, then allow
the disturbed sediment to subside during the next
twelve hours. If the solution is allowed to dry
on the surface, or if this is touched with the
fingers whilst wet, dirty spots will be formed.

The dried plated goods are now polished by
means of suitable mops, dollies, and polishing
materials. Nickel-plated articles may have their
surface finished by polishing them with mops and
dollies charged with Sheffield lime, with fine
Tripoli composition, or with rouge composition.
The lime employed for this purpose is a picked
material, procured from Sheffield, where it is
packed in casks and jars, from which air is
excluded, for transportation to other towns. It
may be applied in the first place for polishing
plane surfaces, together with a little oil, on a
buff bob. When the rough surface has been
brightened in this way, the bob may be removed,
and replaced by a calico mop charged with lime,
by holding a lump to it whilst it revolves. A
good polish is thus obtained, which may be still
further improved by using a dolly made of swan's-down
calico, charged with dry lime from a lump
held in the hand. An assortment of bobs, mops,
and dollies should be kept on hand, including
various sizes and varieties in shape, to go easily
into curves and narrow grooves.

A very good polish can be imparted to nickel
by using first a basil leather mop charged with
fine Tripoli composition, then a calico mop
charged with rouge composition, and finally a
swansdown calico dolly charged with rouge.
This imparts a fine steely lustre to nickel-plated
goods; but the use of rouge on a lathe for polishing
nickel-plated and silver-plated work has the
disadvantage that the rouge flies about the shop,
and gets into cracks and crannies, where the
appearance of the red powder is objectionable,

[Page.]

and from which it is with difficulty removed. It
also penetrates the clothing of the workman, and
gets into his hair.

The work must be kept well alive in front of
the bob, mop, or dolly whilst polishing its surface--
that is, it must be kept moving to and fro or up
and down all the time, so as to prevent the tool
from grinding into one spot, and cutting through
the deposit. Special care must be observed when
approaching sharp angles, the edges of holes, and
sharp corners, as the nickel deposit is soon cut
through at these points, and the work spoiled.
The aim throughout is to get a bright mirror-like
surface on the nickel; and this is not very
difficult if the work has been properly prepared
for plating. If, however, the work has not been
properly prepared, no amount of labour or skill
will enable the finisher to turn out a polished
surface; and for doing the work over again, all
the old nickel must be removed. One method of
doing this is to steep it for a short time in
commercial sulphuric acid, to which is added,
from time to time, a small quantity of nitric
acid. However, owing to the corrosive nature
and fumes of the acid, the nickel is generally
removed with emery bobs, the work being polished
ready for plating at the same time.

A large portion of the plating work to be done
in repairing shops consists of replating the parts
of cycles from which the nickel has been worn.
This is not such easy work as plating new fittings,
for the old parts are generally worn unevenly,
dented, and bruised, and sometimes deeply pitted
with rust. From the preceding instructions for
plating new work, it will be clearly understood
that all parts to be plated must be thoroughly
cleaned; and to do this, it is necessary to take
the machine apart wherever a nut can be
unscrewed, a screw withdrawn, or a key driven.
All nuts, screws, collars, pins, and similar small

[Page.]

articles, must be done apart from the larger fittings.
Handles must be removed from handle-bars,
and rubber from pedals and brakes, if these
are to be plated, since the solutions will spoil all
materials made of ivory, bone, horn, wood, rubber,
vulcanite, ebonite, etc., and the hot potash will
loosen all handles.

The loose dirt may be removed with a wisp of
cotton-waste, and stiff grease should be taken off
with some of the same waste dipped in turps.
All parts to be plated should be thus roughly
cleaned before they are sent to the polisher. If
several parts of more than one cycle have to be
re-plated, the smaller things, such as nuts, collars,
pins, and small bolts, should be bunched together,
tied with strings, and attached to the handle-bar
of the machine to which they belong.

As nickel-plated fittings are more or less tarnished
or stained with rust-marks when sent to the
plater, it is advisable to first submit them to a
leather mop, charged with emery or with coarse
Tripoli composition, to clear the surface from
stains and rust. It can then be seen whether they
have been nickel-plated or not, and measures taken
accordingly. If they have not been plated, and
are merely polished iron or steel, rusted and
stained, the polishing process must go on as for
new parts, special attention being paid to
rust-marks, which are sometimes very deep. If the
parts to be nickelled have been previously
nickel-plated, all the previous coat of nickel must be
stripped off clean before a new coat can be firmly
deposited on them. Nickel will not firmly adhere
to a coat of nickel, even when freshly deposited
and polished: hence the necessity of stripping it
off before a new coat is laid thereon.

A very thin coat of nickel may be ground off
on an emery-wheel whilst preparing the article for
polishing, but it is usual to take off nickel by
means of an acid which will dissolve this metal

[Page.]

without injuriously affecting the metal on which
it is deposited. The stripping acid is composed of
sulphuric acid, nitric acid, and water, mixed in the
following manner:--In a stoneware vessel, capable
of holding more than 12 gallons of liquid, first
place 2 gallons of water; then add to this, in a
cautious manner, 8 gallons of strong sulphuric
acid, pouring it into the water in a thin stream,
and stirring the mixture with a glass rod. This
precaution is necessary, because the addition of
this acid to water is always attended with an
evolution of heat, and a consequent raising of the
temperature of the liquid to almost boiling point.
If water is added to the acid, instead of acid
being added to water, the mixture will bubble as
if boiling, and some of the scalding liquid will be
spurted from the surface, with possibly serious
results. After the sulphuric acid and water have
been mixed, add to the mixture 2 gallons of
commercial nitric acid, and stir all well together.
As the heat generated in a mixture of sulphuric
acid and water is liable to crack stoneware
vessels, a lead-lined tank is preferable to stoneware
for mixing the acids in; but they must be transferred
to a stoneware vessel afterwards, because
the mixture of nitric acid with sulphuric acid will
dissolve lead. It will even dissolve enamel from
iron vessels, and then violently attack the
exposed iron.

The articles to be stripped should be first
cleaned free from grease and oil, swilled in the
potash solution, and then in the hot-water tank,
then wired with stout copper wires, and dipped
in the stripping acid. If the coat of nickel is thin,
it will be dissolved in a few moments. Thicker
coats will take several minutes' immersion, and
very thick coats may require half an hour's
immersion. The work must therefore be closely
watched, and lifted out occasionally for examination,
as each article should be removed from the

[Page.]

stripping acid, and plunged at once in clean cold
water when the nickel has all been stripped off.

As noxious fumes arise from the acid during
the stripping process, this should be conducted in
the open air, or in a recess provided with a flue
and strong up-draught, to carry the fumes off
from the operator. After the articles have been
stripped and rinsed in cold water, they should be
rinsed in hot water, dried in hot sawdust, and then
prepared for plating in the manner already
described. The subsequent operations for replating
and finishing are the same as for new work.

Some notes on the working of nickel-plating
solutions will now be given. Nickel-plating
solutions are always worked cold.

The solution is at its proper working strength
when it contains 1 lb. of nickel sulphate to the
gallon of water. To maintain it at this strength
attention must be paid to the anodes and their
condition. As a rule, the surface of anodes
exposed to the action of the solution should exceed
by one-half the surface of the goods being plated.
The anodes should also freely dissolve in the
solution, and therefore should not be too hard.

If nickel has been drawn from the solution too
fast, it will be liable to become too acid, and this
condition may be ascertained by testing it with
blue litmus paper, which will quickly redden if
acid is in excess. But a slight excess is
permissible when plating iron and steel. An excess
of acidity may be corrected by adding a small
quantity of liquid ammonia; but an addition of
nickel sulphate wdll be required also if the normal
strength of the solution has been reduced. The
hydrometer will show this reduction by comparing
it with a sample of known correct strength. The
readings on the hydrometer scale show the density
of the solution, but not its temperature.

Sulphuric acid should not be added to a nickel-plating
solution without previously testing the

[Page.]

solution with litmus paper and finding it alkaline.
Even then the acid should be added in very small
quantities, and the solution stirred after each
addition, then tested with litmus paper. The
same caution should be exercised in adding ammonia
if the solution is found to contain an excess
of acid. Neutral solutions may be employed in
plating copper and brass.

If slimy yellow feathers appear on the anodes
and on the sides of the vat, the solution is foul,
deficient in nickel salts and their solvent. To
alter this, filter all the solution through good
calico, add one fluid ounce of sulphuric acid to
each gallon, test for acidity with litmus paper,
and add enough liquor ammonia to render the
solution neutral. Work with nickel anodes greatly
in excess of the surface to be coated.

Pinholes in nickel plating are caused by small
air bubbles left on the surface of the articles
when immersed in the plating solution. These
bubbles may be held in pinholes existing in the
surface of the metal, or may form on the smooth
surface itself. They may be broken by a smart
tap on the edge of the article, by shaking it in the
solution, or by sweeping the point of a feather
over the surface. If the solution holds particles
of dust, these may settle on the articles being
plated and cause pinholes. To avoid this, keep
the solution clean by filtering it occasionally
through clean calico.

Black streaks in deposits of nickel are caused
by bubbles of hydrogen gas, which form in clusters
on the surfaces of articles and then burst. They
may be prevented by gently agitating the articles
whilst being plated, or by stroking the clusters
with a stout feather and thus bursting them.

All electro-deposits of metal are slightly porous,
and so when a thin deposit of nickel on steel or
iron is exposed to moisture the tiny drops penetrate
these pores to the metal beneath and cause

[Page.]

rust. A thicker deposit offers a better protection,
or better still is a coat of copper deposited on the
parts and well burnished previous to being coated
with nickel.

Aluminium may be treated much the same as
zinc in preparing it to receive an electro-deposit
of nickel or silver. After it has been well scoured
with Trent sand, it must receive a coat of copper
in a sulphate of copper solution, and be transferred
direct from this to the nickel-plating solution.
Solutions for nickel-plating on aluminium
should not contain any free alkali, but he slightly
acid, since alkalis act on aluminium.

Nickel can be deposited on wax moulds, but
previously the mould must be prepared with black-lead
or with bronze powder as for the electrotype
process, and a thin film of copper deposited upon
it in an electrotype solution (1 lb. of copper
sulphate and 4 oz. of sulphuric acid in 1 gal. of
rainwater). If the object desired is a copy of a
design impressed on the face of the mould, it will be
advisable to remove the mould to the nickel vat
when it has become coated with a very thin film
of copper, and deposit the nickel on this film. If
the design is not undercut, it may be possible to
peel off the film of copper from the nickel; but
some difficulty may be experienced in getting a
deposit of nickel thick enough to form a plate or
sheet, as thick deposits have a tendency to crack,
curl up, and peel off. To get a tough coat, the
nickel should be deposited slowly with a
low-tension current.

CHAPTER VIII.

FINISHING ELECTRO PLATED GOODS.

Properly electro-deposited silver leaves the plating
solution with a pleasing, rough, creamy-white
surface, much like fine unglazed porcelain. It
should be rinsed in clean hot water to free it from
silver salts, and may be dried in clean hot
boxwood sawdust, or scratch-brushed first, then
washed in warm soapsuds, rinsed, and dried to
prepare it for the polisher. Great care must be
taken of the surface, as it is easily soiled and
readily tarnished, and then causes much trouble
to the polisher and finisher, who will have some
difficulty in cleaning the surface. The rinsing
waters must therefore be clean, and the sawdust
free from dirt and burnt or brown particles.
Should the article have a yellowish tinge when
taken from the vat or from the hot sawdust, swill
it at once in a warm dilute solution of potassium
cyanide and rinse and dry.

If the silver-plated surface is to have a higher
polish than that imparted by scratch-brushing, it
must next be held against a revolving swansdown
mop charged with fine rouge. This may be applied
in the form of powder to a mop previously
greased or oiled; but rouge compositions do the
work better, and in working are far more cleanly
than powdered rouge. Avoid rubbing the silver
off angles and projections, and apply pressure
moderately, the surfaces being kept moving to and
fro to prevent the mop cutting into one spot. This
movement is specially necessary when polishing
the coat on soft metals, to prevent blistering, as

[Page.]

the heat generated by friction is liable to cause
buckling of the underlying metal.

Deeply impressed or engraved designs to be
highly polished must be held against a revolving
hair-brush charged with rouge powder.
When a sufficiently high polish has been obtained,
it is advisable to wash out any rouge that
may have lodged in crevices by steeping the
articles in hot soapy Avater and mopping with a
soft woollen mop. After this they should be
rinsed in hot water and dried, then mopped with
a clean swansdown mop. With great care in keeping
mops free from grit, dust, dirt, etc., and
the use of best quality compositions, a high lustre
can be got on silver-plate by mopping alone.

If the deposit blisters and breaks away whilst
being scratch-brushed, the loose silver must be
all got off, either by means of a rough bob or in
a stripping solution, and the surface again
prepared by polishing, scouring, and quicking as
before. The thin preparatory coat may be thus
ground off easily without blotching the surface;
but if the deposit blisters at a later stage it will
be necessary to strip off all the silver in acid and
begin afresh to get a good surface. The articles
to be stripped must be quite dry and attached to
stout wires, then gently moved in ordinary
undiluted sulphuric acid made hot in a stoneware
vessel, and grain saltpetre added in small
quantities at a time until all the silver has been
dissolved. If this is done carefully the acid will do
very little injury to the article. For large articles
a cold stripping solution may be employed; this
is composed of sulphuric acid with a little nitric
acid added from time to time as required.

Small articles, such as buckles, buttons, metal
beads, hooks and eyes, etc., are treated in a
special manner in preparing, silvering, and
finishing. They are prepared by shaking some hundreds
at a time with grit and sawdust in a revolving

[Page.]

barrel or in a stout sack. If it is necessary to
pickle them, they are massed together in a perforated
acid-proof vessel and shaken in this whilst
immersed in the pickles and rinsing waters.
Whilst being plated they are held in a basket
made of brass or copper wire, and this is also to
be kept moving by shaking to prevent contact for
a long time; if this is not done, the articles will
be blotched where they touch each other. By
automatic machines the articles are so kept in
motion whilst being plated that they are in a
polished condition when the silvering is finished.
If these machines are not employed, the articles
must be rinsed and dried, and then polished by
shaking together with sawdust or bran.

With regard to finishing gold-plated work,
strongly gilt articles just taken from the gilding
solution will be found to be coated with a brown
powder. This powder is finely divided gold in a
crystalline condition, the mass of crystals absorbing,
instead of reflecting, the light. To remove
this brown appearance, the articles are briskly
scratch-brushed, the scratch-knot lathe being a
convenient appliance for this purpose. The ends
of the brass wires wear down the points of the
gold crystals, and render the whole surface
smooth. To prevent the brass from wearing off
in the shape of dust and cutting the gold coat, the
brush is kept lubricated with stale beer, and is
covered with a hood, to prevent the lubricant from
being splashed over other things in the workshop.
Rest the work on a sloping piece of board over a
vessel placed so as to catch the drips of stale beer,
and work the brush from left to right, away from
the workman, going over all the surface until all
the brown appearance has been removed. Do not
leave any of this in the crevices. Lastly, rinse
the work in warm water, and dry it in hot boxwood
sawdust. Then polish with dry rouge on a plate
brush, or burnish with a highly polished steel

[Page.]

burnisher, or one of highly polished bloodstone,
using newly made soapsuds as a lubricant.

Stale beer, as stated on the preceding page, is
employed as a lubricant whilst scratch-brushing
electro-plated articles. Unless a lubricant is used,
the brass of the brush wire gets worn off as fine
dust and becomes embedded in the surface of the
plated article, rendering it more or less brassy in
appearance. A tea made of marsh mallows, or
weak linseed tea, can be used instead of the beer.

A still higher polish on electro-plated work
results from the use of steel, agate, and bloodstone
burnishers. These tools are made in a large
variety of shapes to suit all possible surfaces.
The steel burnishers have very highly polished
rubbing surfaces, which must be maintained in
this condition by frequent rubbings on a pad of
buff leather charged with putty powder. Skill in
burnishing is acquired only by practice. The
article is held on a soft pad with one hand, whilst
the burnisher is held firmly by its handle with the
other hand, and pressed hard on the surface with
uniform straight strokes slightly overlapping each
other. The surface of the burnisher may be kept
moist with soapsuds, made either with best soap
or with special burnishing soap. After the steel
burnishing, the finish is imparted with either agate
or bloodstone burnishers, and the whole article
afterwards rinsed in hot water, then dried by
rubbing with a soft linen cloth free from dust.
The mirror-like surface of burnished silver is easily
scratched and soiled, and should not be wiped or
handled more than necessary. Soft metals, such
as pewter, must be burnished very lightly, if at all.

Burnishers in their least expensive form are
made of steel blades varying in shape, running
into the wood. Straight burnishers, shaped as
shown at Fig. 63, and in section at A, are used for
burnishing stems of spoons and forks, and plane
surfaces generally. Curved burnishers, such as

[Page.]

those shown in Figs. 64 to 68, and in section at
B, c, D, E, and F, are used for burnishing the
insides of the bowls of spoons and for hollow
curves. Burnishers made of chips of agate, and of
bloodstone or haematite, set in brass ferrules and
mounted on wood, are more costly than those
made of steel, and they also impart to the goods
a more finished surface. Some further forms of

[Fig. 63.--Straight Burnisher.]

[Figs. 64 to 66.--Curved Burnishers.]

[Fig. 67.--Round Burnisher.]

burnishers in everyday use are shown in Figs.
69 to 72. Special agate burnishers are illustrated
by Figs. 73 to 76.

Buffs are used to impart a perfectly smooth
polish to steel and bloodstone burnishers. When
used for this purpose, the strip of buff leather is
first boiled in water and dried quickly, then glued
to a flat piece of wood a little larger than itself,

[Page.]

and weighted with heavy weights until quite firm.
The buff then resembles a mounted hone or oil-stone,
such as is used by carpenters (see Fig. 77).

It is most important that the work to be
burnished should have been prepared properly for
plating, as on this depends the perfection of the
burnished surface. In the first place, all scratches,
lines, indentations, and corroded pits must be re-

[Fig. 68.--Hooked Burnisher.]

[Fig. 69.--Curved Burnisher.]

[Fig. 70.--Burnisher for Corners, etc.]

[Fig. 71. --Hooked Burnisher.]

[Fig. 72. --Pointed Burnisher.]

moved by filing, rubbing down with water of Ayr
stone, polishing, and burnishing, before the
article is pickled and quicked with mercury
preparatory to being placed in the plating vat. The
slight roughness imparted to the surface by the
action of the acid pickle is not in any way
detrimental, but should a stain be left on the brass
or German silver surface, or should the operator
leave his finger-marks upon it, these will be dis-

[Page.]

tinctly traceable in the surface of the finished
article, even if the spot does not strip under the
burnisher. The utmost cleanliness must be observed
in the preparation of the articles to be
burnished, and care must be taken to put the
quicking coat of mercury on evenly, or the silver
will be apt to strip from slightly soiled spots, as
also from those where thick blotches of mercury
have been left on the surface.

[Figs. 73 to 76.--Agate Burnishers.]

Articles made of pewter, Britannia metal, and
similar alloys are usually difficult to burnish
because they are softer than the overlying coat of
silver, but they are made worse by lack of care
in their preparation; they should be transferred
at once from a clean potash dip to the plating
solution (after being properly cleaned and prepared)
without any intervening rinsing, because
such alloys are readily tarnished when exposed

[Page.]

to the air whilst wet. Potash dissolves the
tarnish.

Silver will strip under the burnisher when it
is deposited too fast or too slow, since its
hardness is greatly affected by its rate of deposition.
The plater should, therefore, find out by trial the
best rate at which to deposit a coat for burnishing
on the several metals or alloys likely to be
employed. Silver will also strip when a plating bath
has been made up by dissolving chloride of silver
in a solution of cyanide of potassium, or when
chloride of silver has been used in building or
faking up a plating solution. A similar result will
follow on the use of too much brightening solution
in the plating bath. Plating solutions thus ruined
should be set aside for the most common work,
allowed to work out, and then treated for recovery
of silver.

Work that is to be burnished should be laid on
a clean soft pad of rag, on which it wi11 be held
during the process.

If an attempt were made to burnish articles
whilst the surface and the burnisher were dry,
the tool would heat and drag off the silver in the
form of fine dust. A lubricant is, therefore,
essential; linseed tea or a decoction of marsh
mallows answer this purpose, as both of these are
of a slippery nature, and are harmless when
applied to silver. Soap-suds are sometimes used,
and these form a fairly good substitute when
freshly made, but they should never be set aside
for use a second time, as they are apt, whilst
standing exposed to the air, to undergo chemical
changes which result in the formation of acids
injurious to the silver coating.

The burnisher must first be polished to a dead
black lustre, by rubbing its edge or face briskly
along a groove worn in a polishing buff charged
with jeweller's rouge. A thin burnisher is first
selected to ground the work, which is afterwards

[Page.]

gone over with one having a broader surface,
finally finishing off with a broad bloodstone
burnisher. The tool is held in the right hand, the
lower part of the handle resting on the outside
of the little finger, and the upper part resting
against the inside of the three other fingers, with
the ball of the thumb on the top of the handle.
In this position great pressure can be brought to
bear upon the tool, if required.

The strokes of the burnisher always should be
given in one direction, since cross strokes will
spoil the appearance of the burnished surface.
Each stroke must be applied with some pressure,
and the burnisher must be kept supplied freely

[Fig. 77.--Buff for Polishing Burnishers.]

with the lubricant, to prevent heating. Each
succeeding stroke should slightly overlap that of
its predecessor, so as not to leave unburnished metal
between the strokes, and a clear, mirror-like
surface behind. As the surface or the edge of the
burnisher gets dull by use, polish it up on the
buff, which is charged with rouge or with the finest
putty powder. Very pleasing effects on ornamental
goods are sometimes obtained by burnishing
certain parts, such as bands and raised parts,
whilst others are left matt. Gold-plated articles
are treated in a similar manner to those of silver,
but it is not usual to burnish nickel, since this
metal is somewhat hard and intractable under the
burnisher. When articles have been burnished,
the finishing polish is put on by hand with soft
rags, charged with a suitable plate powder, or by
a dolly of soft linen revolving in a lathe.

CHAPTER IX.

ELECTRO-PLATING WITH VARIOUS METALS AND ALLOYS.

To make an electro-tinning solution suitable for
small brass and iron articles, dissolve 1 lb. of
common washing soda, 1/2 lb. of best pearlash,
1-1/2 oz. of caustic potash, and 1 dr. of potassium
cyanide in 1-1/2 gal. of warm rainwater; then add
1/4 lb. of tin peroxide and 1 dr. of zinc acetate, well
stir until all is dissolved, and filter through a piece
of calico. This solution should be kept in a
stoneware vessel immersed in hot water in an
outer vessel of metal, as it will have to be kept
at a temperature of 75° F. whilst working. Use
an anode of pure tin and work with a current at
not more than 4 volts. Add small quantities of
caustic potash and potassium cyanide as may be
required to keep the anode and solution in working
order.

A solution for the electrical deposition of iron
has been made by dissolving, in 200 cubic centimetres
of distilled water, 10 gram. of yellow prussiate
of potash and 20 gram. of Rochelle salts.
Then add a solution consisting of 3 gram. of
persulphate of iron and 50 cubic centimetres of water.
To make this ready for use, a solution of caustic
soda is added very slowly, keeping the whole well
stirred, until a clear yellowish liquid is obtained.
Another solution, also due to Boettger, is prepared
by evaporating and crystallising equal parts
of sulphate of iron and sulphate of ammonia.
A solution of the double salt is made, which,
when current is passed, yields a good white
deposit of iron.

[Page.]

Iron-plating solutions may become exhausted
of metal from insufficient anode surface and the
oxidising effect of the atmosphere. The anode
surface should be very greatly in excess of
apparent requirements, best soft charcoal iron being
used. This is necessary because the solution does
not readily dissolve iron, and even a faint current
deposits the iron on the cathode faster than it can
be dissolved from the anodes. Again, iron solutions
exposed to the action of air absorb oxygen
from the atmosphere, and the oxidised iron falls
to the bottom of the vat. Covering the surface
with a film of glycerine helps to protect it from
atmospheric effects. Keeping a faint current
passing through the solution to a small cathode
counteracts these effects.

A solution for the electro-deposition of platinum
is not easy to work, but may be made thus:
In a porcelain capsule dissolve 1 oz. of platinum
scrap in a hot mixture of 1 part nitric acid and
2-1/2 parts of hydrochloric acid. Continue with a
gentle heat until all excess acid has been
evaporated, and the solution assumes the consistency
of thick blood-red syrup, then allow this to
cool and solidify. Next dissolve this deep red salt
(platinum tetrachloride) in hot distilled water,
allow the solution to cool, and filter through
blotting-paper. Add a strong solution of potassium
cyanide to this until it acquires a clear
amber tint, then make up to 1 gal. with distilled
water. Make up the bath in a vessel of enamelled
iron, commence working at a temperature of
112° F. with current from one cell of any battery,
and note results. If good platinum is obtained
from this moderately warm solution with a feeble
current, continue to work it; but if the deposit
is not satisfactory, raise the temperature and
increase the current by using two cells in series.

Platinum solutions demand attention and
careful adjustment of temperature and current. As a

[Page.]

rule, they work best when they contain 1 oz. of
platinum in each gallon of liquid; but, as the
platinum anodes do not dissolve to feed the solutions
and thus make up for metal withdrawn from
them in deposition, they are continually altering
in strength and density. To counteract the effects
of this alteration, it is necessary to increase the
current and raise the temperature of the solution,
or to add enough concentrated solution of the
double salt of platinum and cyanide to keep the
bath up to its original strength.

To make a solution for depositing lead, dissolve
1 lb. of acetate of lead in 1 gal. of water,
and add cyanide of potassium to precipitate the
lead as lead cyanide, and then enough cyanide
to re-dissolve this, and also to form free cyanide.
Work with a pure lead anode and two Bunsens.

A brassing solution for use cold is made with
4 oz. each of carbonate of copper and carbonate
of zinc recently prepared; 8 oz. each of carbonate
of soda in crystals, bisulphate of soda, and pure
cyanide of potassium; 1/10 oz. of white arsenic;
and about 2 gal. of water. Dissolve in water the
copper carbonate and the zinc carbonate, and then
add the soda carbonate and soda bisulphate.
Dissolve in warm water the cyanide of potassium and
the white arsenic, and pour this liquid into the
other, which becomes rapidly decolorised; add
distilled water to make 2 gal. or slightly more.

The following is another method of making an
electro-brassing solution. Procure 4 fluid oz. of
nitric acid and dilute it with 2 fluid oz. of distilled
water; heat the mixture in a glass or porcelain
vessel under the influence of a good draught, and
add cuttings of sheet brass until the acid ceases
to dissolve. Dilute this with four times its bulk
of rainwater, and add liquid ammonia, stirring
until the green precipitate first formed has been
all dissolved, and a clear blue liquid only remains.
To this add a strong solution of potassium cyanide

[Page.]

until the liquid changes in colour from blue to
pink; then add more cyanide cautiously, stirring
until it assumes an amber tint. Allow it to stand
like this for twenty-four hours; then filter the
clear liquid through calico into the vat in which
it is to be used. Work with a good sheet brass anode.

Electro-brassing solutions are known in great
variety, the two just given being among the best
of twenty or more.

The electro-deposition of bronze itself is rarely
practised, since most brassing solutions can be
made to yield a deposit resembling real bronze in
tint, by merely increasing the quantity of copper
ill the deposit. Electro-bronzing can also be done
with an alkaline coppering solution made as
follows: Dissolve 2 oz. of copper sulphate in 1 qt.
of hot water; add this to 1/2 gal. of rainwater
containing 4 oz. of potassium carbonate; then add
2 oz. of liquid ammonia, and stir until the green
precipitate has been dissolved; mix this liquid
with a solution of 6 oz. of potassium cyanide in 1/2
gal. of rainwater, and filter for use. This solution
is best worked at a temperature of 100° F.,
but can be worked cold, with current at a pressure
of from 6 to 9 volts. It deposits a bronze-coloured
copper at low temperatures with the higher voltage.
The bronze tint may be deepened by rinsing
the coppered goods in a solution of sal-ammoniac.
