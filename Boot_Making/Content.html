<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>
	This Handbook contains, in a form convenient for
	everyday use, a comprehensive digest of the knowledge
	of How to Make and Repair Boots and Shoes, scattered
	over ten thousand columns of Work, the weekly
	journal it is my fortune to edit--and supplies concise
	instruction in the general principles of the craft
	on which it treats.
</p>

<p>
	In preparing for publication in book form the mass
	of relevant matter already published in the volumes of
	Work, much that was tautological in character had to be
	rejected. The remainder necessarily had to be arranged
	anew, altered and largely re-written. From these
	causes the contributions of many are so blended that
	the writings of individuals cannot be distinguished for
	acknowledgment.
</p>

<p>
	However, it may be mentioned that a number of articles
	from the pen of Mr. William Greenfield, an
	acknowledged adept in the craft, are incorporated in
	the text. Readers who may desire additional information
	respecting special details of the matters dealt with in this
	Handbook, or instruction on kindred subjects, should
	address a question to Work, so that it may be
	answered in the columns of that journal.

	BOOT MAKING AND MENDING.
</h1>
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<h3>REPAIRING HEELS AND HALF-SOLING.</h3>
</p>

<p>
	Soling and heeling are very necessary operations; for
	boots and shoes are amongst the necessaries of life, and
	soles and heels will wear out. A man who does his own
	repairs at once increases his income, or at least saves a
	continual outlay.
</p>

<p>
	For the processes of heeling and soling, not many tools
	are needed to start with, and the leather can be bought
	in small quantities; and all the necessary grindery (such
	as rivets, brads, pegs, hemp, paste, etc.) can be bought,
	also in small quantities, and at a very low rate.
</p>

<p>
	Suppose gentlemen's boots want heeling and soling,
	the price at which they are done by low-priced repairers
	is 2s. 6d., and then the work is inferior and the leather
	nearly always foreign. Though there are some good
	tannages and parts in foreign stuff, yet low-priced
	repairers use only what are called first-cuts (the neck end
	of the butt), which is the lightest leather both in
	substance and weight, and consequently the cheapest. A
	pair of soles of this material costs 4d. or 5d., the top-pieces
	for the heel 1-1/2d. or 2d.; so the leather does not cost
	more than 7d. at the most; and if such material does not
	last long in wear, it is not surprising. Besides, the soles
	are often put on badly and with long rivets, so that they
	cannot be got off again without pulling the boots all to
	pieces.
</p>

<p>
	There is great importance in keeping heels level, for if
	they are allowed to wear down low, the evil that is caused
	is difficult to remedy; for this not only tends to throw
</p>

<p>
	[Page 10.]
</p>

<p>
	the heel itself on one side, but also causes the sole to
	wear away much quicker, runs the stiffener down at G G
	(Fig. 1), and throws the boot or shoe out of position,
	generally beyond recovery.
</p>

<p>
	Nearly everybody in walking wears down his boot
	heels at one particular spot. Usually the wear occurs
	most at A (Fig. 1), though with some it is at the back of the
	heel; while a few wear most on the inside. The repair
	of these defects is one of the best jobs that a novice at
	the craft can start upon, as the grafting in half-heeling
</p>

<figure id="Figure001">
	<img src="Figures/001.png" />
	<figcaption>

	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	only means butting the new piece of leather against the
	old, and there is no play or friction to cause them to
	come asunder. The leather in very cheap boots and
	shoes is not properly "worked"; this term meaning
	wetted, dried, hammered, etc.
</p>

<p>
	This explains why a new pair of cheap boots worn in the
	wet are, when taken off the feet, lower on one side of the
	heel than on the other, although the leather is not actually
	worn away. It is because the unworked leather yields
	to the pressure caused by the weight of the body in
	walking, and this yielding is the first stage to ruin. To
	prevent this, always have a few extra nails put into new
	boots round the part where most wear occurs.
</p>

<p>
	When the heel is worn down on one side only, it is not
	necessary to take the whole of the top-piece off, but only
</p>

<p>
	[Page 11.]
</p>

<p>
	half of it, which can be replaced with any corner of hard
	sole leather that would be almost useless for any other
	purpose. To remove half of the top-piece, cut it across
	at B C, and should the lift be worn, saw or cut that
	through as well at D E; tack a piece of leather on to take
	the place of the worn piece of lift, putting the tacks in
	at F and F. Then trim it round, and put some odd corner
	of hard sole leather on in like manner, to take the place
	of the worn part of the top-piece. Trim this also, and
	nail it as shown in Fig. 2. In this case, four of the rivets
</p>

<figure id="Figure002">
	<img src="Figures/002.png" />
	<figcaption>

	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	put in at A, B, C, and D should be quite 3/4 in. long, so as
	to hold the lift as well as the top-piece. One, two, three,
	or four rows of rivets may be put in near the edge, but
	they are not much use unless close together. Rivets
	should be put in as shown at E, F, G, and H. This done,
	file them up, and finish in the ordinary way. Do not
	neglect to keep the heel level. This is of special
	importance to those who mend their own boots.
</p>

<p>
	Half-heeling, with plenty of nails close together,
	regularly done, will keep boot heels in proper order; but
	it is not everyone who can spare his boots or who can
	spare the time to do them properly in this way, and when
	this job is once started, the boots cannot be worn until
</p>

<p>
	[Page 12.]
</p>

<p>
	they are finished. It is advisable never to wear a
	top-piece quite through, for the lift is then worn away; and,
	no matter how little this may be, it will need either
	replacing as described above, or repairing by means of a
	skived piece of leather put under.
</p>

<p>
	Before letting new heels wear away, take a piece of
	paper with one straight line and lay this across the heel,
</p>

<figure id="Figure003">
	<img src="Figures/003.png" />
	<figcaption>
		Fig. 3.--Half-Heel Piece Holed and Hammered.

</figure>

<p>
	from J to H (Fig. 2); hold it with two
	fingers of the left hand quite firm at F
	and G; then with the right hand
	smooth it down over the edge from J,
	passing A, B, C, and D on to I; this
	will leave a mark on the paper. Cut
	out to this mark, and it will give a
	good pattern of a half-heel piece, as
	Fig. 3, without the outside line A. To
	this cut another pattern out of stiff
	cardboard, as it will very often be
	wanted for use.
</p>

<p>
	When leisure occurs cut sole
	leather to pieces of this pattern,
	leaving 1/4 in. on all round the curved
	side A (Fig. 3), to give room for
	nailing. Here it will be necessary to
	explain how to make an awl for this
	purpose, as, unlike all other awls, such awls cannot be
	bought ready for use, but it is a tool that saves much
	time and disappointment.
</p>

<p>
	To make this tool, an ordinary handle is used for a
	peg-awl, A (Fig. 4); two pieces of sole leather are put
	on top, as B and C. To secure these, put one short stout
	screw in the centre, and then put a third piece on, as D,
	first cutting a hole in the centre, a little larger than the
	head of the screw, as A (Fig. 5), and then put about five
	rivets in, as B, C, D, E, and F. This is done because the
	awl, when finished, is very stumpy, and requires such
	hard blows to get it in that these would split the wood;
	but by means of the leather this is avoided, and the hole
	in the centre will admit of tightening the screw when
</p>

<p>
	[Page 13.]
</p>

<p>
	necessary. The edge is trimmed up all round, and a
	carpenter's large bradawl is put into the other end. This
	awl has a shoulder to it, therefore the heavy blows will
	not drive it into the handle. When the awl has been

</figure>

<p>
	put into the handle, break it off to about an inch from
	the shoulder; then with a fine file, or on a grindstone,
	taper it to a long, flat, square point, as E (Fig. 4); it
	should be the shape of a French brad (Fig. 7), only
	about 1/4 in. longer, and, of course, smooth.
</p>

<p>
	The piece of leather in Fig. 3 should be of good

<p>
	substance, and should be wet, but not soddened. On it
	mark a line round the curved line from B to C, 1/4 in. from
	the edge, and from these two points make two rows of
	holes with the awl just described, which should be
	dipped into a piece of soap each time before using. A
	hole can be missed in the second line of holes at each
	of the four places d, d, d, d, and a small round hole
	made instead, and four more also made at E, E, E, E;
	then let the leather get nearly dry before hammering it.
	This hammering will make the holes smaller and more
</p>

<p>
	[Page 14.]
</p>

<p>
	irregular-looking than shown in Fig. 3; but this does
	no harm, for so long as the awl is held in the same
	position for each hole, the brads are sure to follow into
	their proper places.
</p>

<p>
	It has been stated above that the awl should be of
	the same shape as a French brad, which is shown in
	Fig. 7; but there is another kind of brad of similar
	shape, only it is much shorter and a little stouter, as
</p>

<figure id="Figure008">
	<img src="Figures/008.png" />
	<figcaption>
		Fig. 8.--Half-Heel Piece Bradded.

<p>
	shown in Fig. 6. This is called a
	cut-bill, and it is this brad that must
	be used to put into the holes made
	in Fig. 3. Let the length of the brads
	be as nearly equal to the substance of
	the leather as possible; lay the leather
	upon a piece of wood, and knock the
	brads in the square holes one at a
	time. When they are all in, take the
	leather off the wood, and lay it on the
	lap-iron with the points of the brads
	upwards. These, if they are not too
	far through, can be clenched and made
	smooth by tapping with a hammer;
	but if they are through far before trying
	to clench them, they must be cut
	off with a pair of cutting tongs close to
	the leather.
</p>

<p>
	This done, the half-heel is ready for use. Several
	may be prepared, and then all that is necessary to half-
	heel the boots is to cut the top-piece across, as shown,
	from J to H (Fig. 2), take away the worn part, and
	replace it with the new piece. Fig. 8 shows where it
	should be bradded, and also the places for eight 5/8 in.
	rivets; these are all that is necessary to hold the piece on,
	and will allow it be taken off easily when another heel-piece
	is wanted.
</p>

<p>
	It will be found that the small margin, A B (Fig.8),
	after the brads have been put in, has become somewhat
	contracted. This is why the extra 1/4 in. of leather was
	left, for it would break if nailed close to the edge. Now
</p>

<p>
	[Page 15.]
</p>

<p>
	you can trim up the edge of the piece to the edge of the
	heel, cutting close to the brads, on the line C to D, and
	finish in the ordinary way. The first time the boots are
	half-heeled, it will be necessary to put four rivets in the
	old leather at E, F, G, and H (Fig. 8), to keep it from
	ripping off.
</p>

<p>
	Another good and easy way to half-heel boots is to
	get a pair of Snow's patent leather-plugged half-tips (Fig.
</p>

<figure id="Figure009-010">
	<img src="Figures/009-010.png" />
	<figcaption>
		Fig. 9.--Snow's Leather-plugged Half-tip.
		Fig. 10.--Heel Prepared for Half-tip.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	9), price 1-1/2d. Put one on the heel in its proper position,
	mark round the inside from A to B (Fig. 10), and cut
	away the part, C, that the tip is going to replace. Lay
	the tip on the lap-iron face down, and hollow it in the
	centre, that it may grip well at both ends, then dip
	it in water to soften the leather plugs, and put it on the
	heel. With a fine awl make a hole through the centre
	of each plug, and put a long rivet, which would be
	supplied with the tips, in each hole. Smooth it up with
	a file where rough, and you have a new lease of heel
	wear for l-1/2d., and a very little trouble. If it is found
	difficult to cut the curved line to fit the tip from A and
	B, cut the heel straight across, as in Fig. 2, from J to H,
	and after the tip is on cut a small piece, as D (Fig. 10)
</p>

<p>
	[Page 16.]
</p>

<p>
	and nail it in with four rivets. To get D the proper
	shape, let it have one straight side, and press that against
	the old leather. Hammer the leather on the tip--this
	will make a mark underneath--cut through this line,
	and you have the shape required.
</p>

<p>
	Perhaps it is well to mention here that for beginners
	heeling and underlaying--that is, placing pieces under
	the soles--is better work to start upon, as by such work
	the use of the tools will be gradually acquired, and
	sufficient skill obtained to warrant attempting the harder
	task of soling and heeling throughout.
</p>

<p>
	Suppose, as is often the case, your boots want the
	heels set up on one side only, and a piece is wanted
</p>

<figure id="Figure011">
	<img src="Figures/011.png" />
	<figcaption>
		Fig. 11.--Fixing Heel with Screws.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	under the side of the soles, or a toe-piece is wanted. A
	job like this can be done with very few tools. But
	it is well always to buy a tool when you want it, and
	always to try and do the work as well as possible; for
	by taking pains with the work, you will soon be making
	progress. Boot repairing comes under every man's notice,
	so he has some idea how it should look when finished.
</p>

<p>
	In the case of a heel that has given way by parting
	from the shoe, the best way to repair it is to bore two
	holes from inside the shoe, each large enough to admit a
	joiner's screw to pass though, as at A in Fig. 11, and then
	make two small holes into the heel at B, as a lead for
</p>

<p>
	[Page 17.]
</p>

<p>
	the screws, which can be about 3/4 in. or 1 in. long.
	From the inside screw the two well into the heel, as at
	C; then put the shoe on an iron foot, and drive in a
	long French nail from the top, just behind the screws, as
	at D, and the heel will be as solid as it was at first.
	Perhaps, by putting in another screw the nail may be
</p>

</figure>

<p>
	dispensed with, and if so, so much the better, as then
	nothing of the repair can be seen from the outside.
</p>

<p>
	A sharpening strop (Fig. 12) is indispensable to the
	shoemaker. It is generally a solid piece of square wood,
</p>

<figure id="Figure013">
	<img src="Figures/013.png" />
	<figcaption>
		Fig. 13.--End View of Strop.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	about 16 in. long, shaped at one
	end to form the handle, A, about
	4 in. long. A useful hollow
	one may be made in this way:
	Take four pieces of wood, 1/4 in.
	thick, 12 in. long, and about
	1-3/4 in. wide: place them
	together, as shown at Fig. 13, and
	fix them with screws, illustrated
	at B, B, B, B. Then cut a square
	piece, as C, and fix it with two
	French nails at each side, as D D <br />
	(Fig. 13). Then have a square piece of wood, the same
	substance, about 6 in. long, and shape it for the handle, as
	A (Fig. 12), leaving about 2 in. square to form a stopper for
	the square case, which will be found very handy to keep
	spare awls in and also broken awls, the use of which will
	be explained later on. It is also very convenient to keep
	a sharp knife in, for if left with other tools, this gets
	blunt, and when picking up another tool, you are apt to
	cut your hand if the knife is lying on the bench.
</p>

<p>
	When the strop has been completed, as shown in
	Fig. 12, paste a piece of leather on one side, and on the
</p>

<p>
	[Page 18.]
</p>

<p>
	other three sides paste emery-cloth, Nos. 1-1/2, 1, and
	F F. For putting a fine edge to the knife use the F F, dip
	the blade of the knife in water, and finish on the leather
	side. In sharpening a knife, always hold the blade
	quite flat on the strop, or you will produce a round edge,
	which makes it hard to use.
</p>

<p>
	Paste is very often wanted. A halfpennyworth can
	be bought at any grindery shop. But it so soon gets dry,
	and some of it is sure to be wasted. The better way is
	to make paste thus: put a table-spoonful of rye-flour
	into a jar, add a little boiling water to it, and well stir;
	this is economical, and you can always have paste in a
	few minutes.
</p>

<p>
	To sole and heel a pair of boots, procure a pair of
	soles of English tannage, costing from 9d., and top-pieces
	from 3d.; a halfpennyworth of iron rivets, at 3d. lb.:
	1/2 in. is a very useful size; sand-paper, 1 sheet, size 1-1/2,
	cost 1/2d.; and shoemakers' ink, 1/2d. A better sole would
	not be got at many full-priced shops.
</p>

<p>
	Most important and most needed tools are an iron
	foot (Fig. 17), a shoemaker's hammer, knife (Fig. 82),
	nippers, glazing iron (Fig. 30), and rasp (Fig. 27). This
	list of tools does not include sufficient to turn out all
	kinds of work properly, but the number is cut down so
	that the first four or five repairing jobs, including tools,
	shall cost no more than if they had been done by an
	ordinary repairer.
</p>

<p>
	Now we have leather and tools, we will start work.
	If you sit on an ordinary chair, it should be cut down
	to about 14 in.; or any seat that height will do. Your
	tools, for the present, can be put on the floor or on the
	box you keep them in; but a shoemaker's bench is
	of course better.
</p>

<p>
	The illustration Fig. 14 shows that it is not very hard
	to construct a shoemaker's bench, though, if the one
	shown is too elaborate, the drawers can be dispensed
	with. Even a sugar-box will suffice, taking the lid off
	and laying it on its side, the open top being A, where
	one or even more drawers can be made to fit in. The
</p>

<p>
	[Page 19.]
</p>

<p>
	lid will make the back, and the beads for the two sides
	and front marked B B B and B, which are about 1-1/2 in.
	above the side of the box. Compartments can be made
	at C C to receive the grindery in use, one especially to fit
	the ink-bottle, that it may not get knocked over.
</p>

<p>
	To tell a hand-sewn boot from one that is machine-sewn,
	first take the sock out, and if there are stitches all
	round inside, on the inner sole, the boots are
	machine-sewn. If the inner sole is smooth, they are either <br />
</p>

<figure id="Figure014">
	<img src="Figures/014.png" />
	<figcaption>
		Fig. 14.--Shoemaker's Bench.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	hand-sewn, standard-screw, or a combination. If they are
	standard-screw, the marks of a small round disc show on
	the inner sole. The screw wire is put in so that it
	seldom shows on the inside, but if the centre of this
	impression is scraped away, the brass screw wire will
	be brought to light and prove the make. A machine-sewn
	welt (the nearest approach to hand-sewn) will
	show a real and good stitch all round the outside.
	Machine-sewn boots or shoes are much heavier than
	hand-sewn. Another guide is the inside of the heel, for
	generally machine-sewn boots have heels that are put on
	by a heeling machine, in which you can see either the
	heads or clenched points on the inner sole of the seat.
	Or the heels are nailed on by hand, which can be told
</p>

<p>
	[Page 20.]
</p>

<p>
	in the same way. For this reason machine-made boots
	often have a whole or half inner sole in them, but if
	this is taken out it can soon be replaced. Men who do
	hand-sewn work do not build theirs in this way, for if not
	sewn they are pegged.
</p>

<p>
	Now to sole and heel a pair of riveted or machine-sewn
	boots, which require new soles to be riveted on.
	First dip into water the old soles and heels of the boots
	and hold them in for a few minutes; let them dry a
</p>

<figure id="Figure015">
	<img src="Figures/015.png" />
	<figcaption>
		Fig. 15.--Heel prepared for Repairing.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	little, so as to have them just mellow. The new leather
	must be put in water, and thoroughly wetted through;
	then taken out, and allowed to get nearly dry, but not
	by the fire, if this can be helped. Rasp off all rough
	flaky stuff from the flesh side. Place the lap-iron--
	which is simply a laundress's iron with the handle off--
	on your thighs, just above the knees, put the leather on
	it, grain side down, and, commencing from the centre,
	hammer it well, evenly and gently. This makes the
	leather more dense and more resistive to wear, and also
	more impervious to dampness. While the leather dries,
	take off the old top-pieces that are worn, and if the
	lifts are worn, cut or saw them through the centre,
	and take away the portion that is worn, as a (Fig. 15).
</p>

<p>
	[Page 21.]
</p>

<p>
	This can then be replaced by a piece of new leather,
	which need not be of the best quality. There are other
	ways of building up heels, which will be explained as we
	make progress.
</p>

<p>
	This operation of taking off the old soles requires some
	care. If the boots are wetted, they are far less likely to
	fall to pieces and otherwise give trouble than if they are
	worked upon in a dry state. When taking off the sole,
	a last can be put in the boot, to make a solid foundation
	to work on; the old sole can be prised off with a blunt
	chisel when it is wet, commencing at the toe or the
	thinnest part; this will enable you to catch hold of it with
</p>

<figure id="Figure016">
	<img src="Figures/016.png" />
	<figcaption>
		Fig. 16.--Rivets in a Boot Sole.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	nippers. By means of these pull off the sole with the
	nippers in one hand, and at the same time hold down
	with the other the under leather (often termed welt, or
	runner). Should the under part still have a tendency to
	give way from the uppers, knock back the sole, so that
	it leaves the rivets sticking out; with the pincers or
	nippers pull out the rivets, and repeat the processes till
	the sole is got off without disturbing the boot. Before
	putting the new sole on, the under part can be naiied
	down with a few short rivets to make it solid. If in the
	making or previous repairing very long rivets have been
	used, taking off the sole will need great care to avoid
	causing the boot to fall to pieces. As your own repairer,
	never let your boots wear low, for here "a stitch in
	time saves nine"; and the cheaper the boots, the more
	applicable this adage.
</p>

<p>
	For re-soling machine-sewn boots and shoes, follow
	the advice given in connection with hand-sewn work.
</p>

<p>
	[Page 22.]
</p>

<p>
	The following is another system for sewn work:--When
	the lasts are in, and the boots wet, skive off the
	edge of the sole: not right through, or you may spoil the
	welt, but deep enough to cut through the stitches
	and cut their loops off. Then, as before, the toe can be
	raised or prised up from the welt, when taking off the
	sole is an easy matter.
</p>

<p>
	If the under-sole should come away whilst taking off
	the outer one, the damage must be made good. This
</p>

<figure id="Figure017-018">
	<img src="Figures/017-018.png" />
	<figcaption>
		Fig. 17.--Iron Foot used in Re-Soling.
		Fig. 18.--Iron Last and Stand.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	can be done in the following manner:--If you are
	repairing on an iron last or an iron-bottom last, hammer
	the middle or under-sole back into its place, first taking
	out all the old nails; then, supposing A A in Fig. 16 to
	show the line where the rivets which fix the new sole
	will pass through the middle sole, put through the
	line B B a few short rivets or long tingles, according to
	the substance of the bottom. The dots, B B, show where
	the tingle; should be put. They should be only just long
	enough to clench on the bottom of the last.
</p>

<p>
	When repairing on a wooden last, and this undersole
	is being fixed, take the shoe off and slip it on the
</p>

<p>
	[Page 23.]
</p>

<p>
	iron foot to clench the tingles, for they must be clenched
	before the new sole is put on. When putting the
	new sole on and knocking in the rivets, put extra long
	ones in, say an inch apart: just long enough to clench
	through the whole thickness of the new sole, middle
	sole, tops, inner sole, etc. The long rivets should be of
	brass, so that when the shoe is again re-soled these will
	draw out with the thin old sole, and not disturb the
	middle sole in so doing.
</p>

<p>
	The cause of boots falling to pieces, as they some

<p>
	times do after a short period of wear, is frequently the
	want of a good solid inner sole. If not gone too far, and
	if when pulling the sole off the boots are not pulled to
	pieces, remedy this defect by putting a new half inner
	sole in the forepart, and then re-sole the boots on the
	iron foot. If they are past this, and the uppers are good
	enough, re-last the forepart on a pair of iron lasts or a
	pair of iron-plated ones.
</p>

<p>
	To obtain the required lasts, the size of foot must
	be taken in inches. Draw the tape measure just a little
	tighter than you would like the boot, and then send off
	the order thus: 1 pr. gent's (boot or shoe) lasts, joint
	9 in., instep 9-1/2 in., as the case may be. Iron-plated
	ones are the cheaper, as iron stem and stand, which
</p>

<p>
	[Page 24.]
</p>

<p>
	cost 2s., are wanted with the iron lasts; but an iron-plated
	last, screwed to a bench, gives you the advantage
	of being able to stand at work. Figs. 17 and 18 show
	last and stand, which can be got at any leather warehouse.
</p>

<p>
	Figs. 19 and 20 show a useful stand for repairing
	purposes which allows the foot to be fixed firmly in
	either of the two positions.
</p>

<p>
	The old sole should be cut off at the waist to within
</p>

<p>
	about 3/4 in. from where the new sole is to come. Mark
	off the exact length of the new sole, and then start to
	skive off from this mark, tapered to where the old sole
	was cut off. From the line scoop it out evenly with
	a knife, until about one-third of the way through (as
	A, in Fig. 21). Then lightly tap down the leather, right
	across where hollowed out; this should be done with
	the pene end of the hammer. This process hardens the
	leather to receive the pegs or rivets and, without weakening
	the old leather, gives an extra drop to receive the
	new sole. The new sole to be spliced to this part of the
	waist of the boot must be skived, but not very thin; and
</p>

<p>
	[Page 25.]
</p>

<p>
	it is best to skive on the flesh side for light work, and
	on the grain side for heavy work. Slightly paste the
	groove in the old leather, and also the new sole, where it
	has been skived; this tends to make the graft sound and
	firm when finished. It is all important to properly
	work the leather before using--that is, by wetting, fleshing,
	drying, and hammering, as explained on p. 20.
</p>

<p>
	In levelling up for re-soling, the proper way is to

	<figcaption>
		Fig. 23.--New Sole Fastened in Groove.
		Fig. 24.--New Sole finally Fitted.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	make the sole just a little rounded, putting in just
	enough filling to make this difference. The bottom of a
	boot, if too round, is sometimes uncomfortable, and
	wears away quickly, whilst one hollow in the centre is
	uncomfortable and unsolid. A last should be somewhat
	round at the bottom, so that it fits the bottom or sole of
	the foot. The sole of the boot will be made round enough
	by placing a layer of felt in the middle, to prevent creaking,
	and make it impervious to dampness as far as possible.
	This applies both to making and to repairing.
</p>

<p>
	To fix on the new sole, place the boot or shoe onan

	iron foot. The sole should be put on with the skived
	end to overlap the groove about 1/8 in., as shown at A
	(Fig. 22). When riveted, it should be well into the
	groove, as shown at A (Fig. 23). If the graft is well done,

	Before putting in the rivets, pare up the sole--not

	Trim up the sole's edge with the knife, being very
	careful not to cut the uppers; then damp the edge, and

	pene it all round with the hammer. This should be
	done with the shoe on the knees, the heel being towards
	you and the edge of the sole upwards, and pened by
	hammering, as shown in Fig. 26 at A B, commencing at
	A, and going right round the sole. This process is
	important, as it hardens the edge, tends to make it hollow,
	and prepares it to receive the next tool, which is the
	rasp (Fig. 27). The toe end of a shoe is illustrated on
	a larger scale at Fig. 28, which shows how the pening
	strokes should be laid to w^eld the new and old leather
	together, and keep the edge hollow, as at A (Fig. 28).
	Then let the whole boot dry, while you proceed with
	the other one.
</p>

<p>
	When you repair your own boots, never let the heels
	wear more than just through the top-piece: then the
	heels keep in shape; but if you have to repair the lifts
	when putting the pieces on, let the nails be a little way
	from the edge, or when the top-piece is nailed on one
	set of nails will come in contact with those below, and
	produce unpleasant results. When building up the heel,
	ready for the top-piece, it is well to make that side
	where the most wear is a little higher, as it tends to
	make the wear more even. Tack the top-piece on the
	heel (Fig. 29), putting a nail at A and one at B, and round
	it up with the knife, leaving a little stuff on all round,
	more particularly at that part which is to receive the
	most nails, as shown by the dotted line. The rivets
	should then be put in, as shown at C C, but first mark
	round the heel and hole it, as was done for the sole,
	then pare and pene, as described above; the edges of
	the soles and heels should then be rasped, then buffed
	with a scraper or buffing-knife.
</p>

<p>
	This tool, which is illustrated on p. 126, is similar to a
	cabinet-maker's scraper, and it can be made of about
	3 in. of old stay-busk. Such a tool can be bought, but it
	is seldom ready for use, so you might as well make one;
	and a piece of freshly-broken glass will suffice. Then
	sand-paper the edges with a piece of No. 1-1/2 sand-paper.
	The faces of the sole and heel can be filed with the file

<p>
	side of the rasp, to make the heads of the rivets smooth
	and even with the leather; then buff off the grain of the
	leather with the scraper, and sand-paper the sole all
	over. This produces what is called a rough bottom, and
	all that is needed for own work. Rub a little paste on
	the edges with a piece of rag, and ink the edges and the
	waist, using shoemaker's ink, American is best. This is
	allowed to get just dry, then the leather is rubbed over

<p>
	with the glazing-iron (Fig. 30). This
	iron must not be very hot; its proper
	heat is such that if it is put into water
	it should just cause a hiss. Properly,
	a forepart iron should be used for the
	soles, but the glazer will do for a
	makeshift. This ironing process gives
	a nice gloss, which is increased and
	made more permanent by being
	repeated, at the same time ironing on
	a thin coat of heel-ball, which can be
	rubbed off smooth with a piece of old
	cloth, and will leave a brilliant polish.
</p>

<p>
	Always remember that any job in
	repairing can be finished much better if a last is inside
	the boot; and that pening, rasping, buffing, and all
	finishing, should be commenced from A for the soles
	(Fig. 26), and from B (Fig. 24) for the heels. In using
	the knife, the action is the reverse in both cases.
</p>

<p>
	Gutta-percha makes by no means bad soles, and with
	it no great difficulty will be found in either patching or
	entirely re-soling boots. It is not recommended for use
	on neat light boots; but many an old pair of boots which
	are looked on as past wear can thus be made thoroughly
	useful for winter wear; for it must be remembered that
	gutta-percha is waterproof. It is also light in weight,
	and is warm to the feet. It is, however, chiefly on the
	grounds of economy and the ease wdth which it can be
	used that gutta-percha is to be recommended.
</p>

<p>
	The gutta-percha necessary can be got at any india-rubber
	shop. It is sold in pieces about 1/4 in. thick, and
</p>

<p>
	[Page 30.]
</p>

<p>
	only as much as may be wanted need be bought.
	The measurement roughly can easily be got. Some
	cement will also be required; that used for fastening
	the india-rubber tyres on cycles, etc., is excellent for
	the purpose. Cuttings of gutta-percha could be used
	instead, but would not be found so satisfactory, except
	perhaps to stick a patch on a worn piece of gutta-percha
	sole. In this case, though, a cement of any kind is
	hardly necessary, as the two surfaces on being made
	sticky by heat, will adhere without a medium.
</p>

<p>
	The soles to be repaired must be thoroughly dry
	before commencing operations; for if they be in the
	slightest degree damp, the new soles, though they may
	adhere for a time, will certainly come off ere long. That
	any dirt or clay must be cleaned off, goes without saying.
	It may be advisable to tear off the bottom layer of
	leather, in which case a neater-looking job perhaps
	will result; or you may just take the boot as it is, and
	lay the gutta-percha on. In either case, the work is the
	same. It is well to heat the soles of the boots and put the
	cement on while they are warm. The cement may
	be melted either in a ladle and poured on, spreading it
	thinly, or be used like sealing-wax by melting it as
	required and rubbing it on the boot; or pieces may be
	put on the boot and melted, and spread with a piece of
	hot iron--the kitchen poker, an old knife, or anything
	of the kind will do very well. Perhaps this last method
	is the best, as the hot iron seems to work the cement
	well into the leather, which, by the way, may first be
	roughened with advantage by rasping; or even scoring
	and scratching with a knife will suffice.
</p>

<p>
	When cement is used it should be evenly spread
	upon the leather, and while hot it is extremely
	tenacious. If it gets cold before the gutta-percha is
	ready to apply, it may be heated by the hot iron or over
	a gas or lamp flame, or at the fire. The great thing is to
	bring the gutta-percha and the boots in contact while
	the cement is quite hot. The gutta-percha also should
	be hot: on the side of adherence hot enough to be soft
</p>

<p>
	[Page 31.]
</p>

<p>
	and sticky. This can easily be managed by holding it
	close to the fire for a short time just before putting it on
	the boot. The gutta-percha should then be firmly, but
	gently, pressed to the boot. It will be flexible enough
	to yield to pressure and follow the curve of the sole if it
	has been sufficiently warmed.
</p>

<p>
	When the new sole is firm and hard--as it will soon
	become if the boot is put in a cool place--the edges may
	be trimmed off. This can be done with a knife; as the
	gutta-percha can be easily cut. The cuttings should be
	kept, as they come in useful for re-patching the sole as it
	becomes worn in places, so that there need be little, if
	any, waste. The final touches may be given by drawing
	a hot iron of any kind over the edges, so as to smooth
	them down.
</p>

<p>
	The sole as now made will wear a considerable time,
	though not so long as leather, but the wear-resisting
	qualities of gutta-percha may be much increased by the
	use of boot protectors. These are small pieces of iron
	for fastening on to the sole in parts most susceptible to
	wear. They can easily be fixed. The caution that
	boots with gutta-percha soles should not be placed too
	near a fire may not be unnecessary, but beyond this, no
	special precaution is necessary any more than in the
	case of leather.
</p>

<p>
	Briefly stated, the cost of the tools mentioned in this
	chapter is as follows:--An iron foot may be bought at
	1-1/2d. per lb., and a handle for 5d; or Snow's Handy Last
	foot may be purchased for 2s. A shoemaker's knife
	costs 2-1/2d., a hammer 6d., nippers 5-1/2d., glazing-iron
	6d., and a forepart iron 8d. These may be obtained at
	any grindery shop.

<h3>
	PATCHING BOOTS AND SHOES.
</h3>

<p>
	It often happens that the uppers of boots or shoes
	want some repairing, such as stitching or patching.
	An explanation of some of the principal methods of
	repairing defects in the uppers, with the way also of
	fastening down to the sole such patches as need it, will
	therefore be useful. The patch can be fastened down
	to the sole by sewing; but if the boot has to be soled,
	and it is not hand-sewn, the sole (or welt, as the
	underneath sole is termed in machine-sewn boots) can be
	prised from the upper where the patch is coming, and
	the patch tucked under, as the original leather is.
	When it is smooth, with no fulness, the under sole can
	be tacked down with a few small tacks, to secure it till
	the sole is put on. A few rivets (say, every alternate
	one at this part) longer than those used to nail the sole
	on with will make the boot as solid as it was at first.
</p>

<p>
	Perhaps the neatest and most solid way to put on a
	patch is to close it in. This is done by cutting away the
	worn or cracked part of the old leather, as shown on p.33
	(Fig. 32). The cut should not have more curve than is
	necessary, for the straighter the cut from B to C, the
	easier will it be to sew in the patch. In cutting out the
	piece, be careful not to cut the lining; doing so would put
	an unnecessary strain on the patch, as it would then be left
	without protection against stress in wear. Cut the piece
	away at the bottom close to the sole. Select a piece of
	new leather of good quality; if the old leather is calf,
	use calf again; if it is horse, or porpoise, use calf also,
	as near the same substance as possible. For any other
	kind of leather, such as kid, patent, etc., the patch should
	match. Lay the patch cut out upon the new leather, and
	cut the piece full large, as shown by Fig. 31; if it is to
</p>

<p>
	[Page 33.]
</p>

<p>
	be tucked under it will need to be the full size shown;
	but if it is to be sewn down, it will only want to be as
	large as the dotted line in the figure. It will be noticed
</p>

<figure id="Figure031">

	<figcaption>

	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	that the new piece has not quite so much curve as the
	old. This is to give a fulness to the patch equal to that
	which the foot has made in the old leather. The cut
</p>

<figure id="Figure032">
	<img src="Figures/032.png" />
	<figcaption>

	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	from A to B must be even and smooth, and holes must
	be made on the wrong side, as shown in Fig. 32 at D D.
	Place the patch face down on a board, and at about
	1/16th in. from the edge make a hole with a closing-awl,
	E (Fig. 32), letting the point come out in the thickness of
	the patch as near to the face side as possible without
	actually going through. Similar holes are made the
	whole way round the curved edge, putting about fourteen
	stitches to the inch.
</p>

<p>
	The patch can now be closed to the boot, first slightly
	wetting the edge of the old leather. Do not start to sew
</p>

<p>
	[Page 34.]
</p>

<p>
	quite at the end of the new leather, or, when turned
	over, it will be deficient at the corner. The awl must
	be put right through the old leather, near to the edge,
	so as not to make a hard seam.
</p>

<p>
	For calf or any stout leather, the wax-end or thread
	will be made with three strands of fine flax, and have
	bristles on each end. The way to make threads is
	explained on p. 60. For kid, or any light leather,
	twist or stoutish black thread will do; a tapered end is
	easily made to either of these by untwisting it for about
	an inch and a half, scraping it gently between the
</p>

<figure id="Figure033">
	<img src="Figures/033.png" />
	<figcaption>
		Fig. 33.--Patch completed.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	thumb and a blunt knife. Then wet or wax the thread,
	and twist it back, holding each one separately in the
	left hand about four inches down, and with the right
	hand twist the end on the right knee--not too hard, or
	you may twist off the fine taper that is wanted to
	receive the bristle.
</p>

<p>
	In stitching this patch, as in all stitching or sewing,
	each stitch should have the same tension put uponit, at
	the same time being careful not to pull too hard on the
	stitch that is to lie on the old leather.
</p>

<p>
	When the patch is sewn right across, again wet it,
	and scrape off the rough edge, rub it down, and turn the
	patch on its right side. Put a last inside the boot, and
	rub the seam down lightly, but well, on the right side.
	This can be done with the handle of a table-knife, or
	anything hard and smooth.
</p>

<p>
	[Page 35.]
</p>

<p>
	Should the vamp be cracked in several places, as
	F, G, and H (Fig. 32), then it will be best to put in a
	new wing. It can be closed in from I to J as described
	above, and blind-stabbed from J to K. In a case like
	this, it is well to have the top edge a little larger all
	round, to hide the old holes, and, if it is not a leather
</p>

<figure id="Figure034">
	<img src="Figures/034.png" />
	<figcaption>

	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	that has the grain side out, at this part it must be skived
	on the wrong side a little thinner, about 1/4 in. wide.
	After this kind of seam is rubbed down, it will be made
	much neater if lightly buffed, or scraped, across from
	A to B (Fig. 33), and then rubbed down again. If this
	sort of patch is put on well, it can scarcely be seen after
	the boot has been blackened and shined.
</p>

<p>
	Previous to sewing the patch down to the sole, the
	crevice where the old piece was cut off must be slightly
	opened with a chisel, or piece of tapered wood or bone
	and the patch tucked in, as shown at a (Fig. 34). This
	is to enable the stitches to be got as far back and as
</p>

<p>
	[Page 36.]
</p>

<p>
	much out of sight as possible in sewing the patch down.
	For sewing the patch to the sole, a sewing-awl must be
	used: it is similar to the closing-awl, only it has a
	stouter and wider blade.
</p>

<p>
	The thread for ordinary work will be about ten-cord,
	or No. 9 Patent (price, 2d. per ball), and the awl,
	although it has to carry the two ends, should only be
	the substance of one.
</p>

<p>
	The boot is laid upon the knees, patch side up, and
	when the piece is on the side shown in the figures, the
	boot must lay on the lap, toe from you. It must be held
	very firmly on the knees by means of a strap or stout
	piece of cord placed round it, as b (Fig. 34), and passing
	under the ball of the foot. By this means the boot can be
	held as tightly as you please by simply pressing down
	the toe.
</p>

<p>
	The stitching must be started from A (Fig. 33), the
	point of the awl being put in on the welt side, A, and
	pushed through the sole to the bottom, wriggling the
	awl a little, that it may find or make its own way
	through at C. In all sewing, stitching, or stabbing, the
	bristle on the left side is put in first, and the one on the
	right side is put in underneath it, so that when the
	stitch is set it shall be between the thread (on the right
	side) and the patch. This will help to lay the stitch
	back, and will make the stitches look even and lay flat.
	The stitching must be continued right across to B
	(Fig. 33), setting about five stitches to the inch, and
	tucking the patch well under before each stitch is taken.
</p>

<p>
	This stitching done, and the ends of threads cut off,
	the stitches must be rubbed down with the bone on the
	patch side, and lightly hammered down on the sole side.
	The surplus of the patch can now be cut off level to the
	edge of the sole, as shown at C (Fig. 34). The edge can
	be blacked with ink or blacking, and then rubbed down.
	A little weak paste on the patch will, if let dry, make it
	smooth to receive the blacking, and the whole, when
	blackened and polished, will be a neat and a very solid
	seam.
</p>

<p>
	[Page 37.]
</p>

<p>
	The neatest patching is called "Invisible," and
	this is stuck on with a solution of gutta-percha. Its
	solvent has an unpleasant smell, but it evaporates
	very quickly. This solution can be bought at 2d. per
	bottle, and when not in use it must be kept well corked.
	Warman's has a scent mixed with it, so it does not
	smell quite so bad; but Sand's is preferable, for quality
	if not for smell. Both can be got at most leather-sellers'
	or grindery shops.
</p>

<p>
	To fit the new patch on the old leather, it is of all
	importance to have a last, boot-stretcher, tree, or some
	such thing in the boot, so that the part to be operated
</p>

<figure id="Figure035-036">
	<img src="Figures/035-036.png" />
	<figcaption>
		Figs. 35, 36.--Leather Skived to form Patches.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	on may be quite solid. Skiving is the principal feature
	in invisible patches, for it is fitting the piece to a nicety
	that makes the patch invisible.
</p>

<p>
	Skiving is a process so essential, that all who do
	not know how to do it well are advised to try their hand
	at it as much as possible with a sharp knife, using any
	old odd piece of upper leather, on a piece of smooth
	marble or board. Skiving means making a tapered
	edge to the leather on one side or the other. Further
	instructions on skiving are given on p. 45.
</p>

<p>
	The safest way to get the patch the right size is to
	cut a piece of paper about 1/4 in. larger all round than is
	necessary to cover the worn or cracked parts. This is to
	admit of the skiving. Then, seeing that this is of good
	shape, cut the patch of new leather to it. This should
	be calf for calf, kid for kid, etc. Kid is a leather that
	has the grain side for the face, and must not be scraped.
	Calf may be, as the grain side is the wrong side, and the
</p>

<p>
	[Page 38.]
</p>

<p>
	flesh the face. After the patch has been cut out to
	shape (Figs. 35 and 36), proceed to skive the edge. Skive
	all round if oval (Fig. 35), and round the curve only if
	semi-circular (Fig. 36). It should be skived from the
	letters A A A to the edge B B B, and at this part it
	should be skived to nothing.
</p>

<p>
	The difference between invisible patches and those
	to be closed in is that in the former the new patch is
	cut first, and the old leather fitted to it afterwards, and
</p>

<figure id="Figure037">
	<img src="Figures/037.png" />
	<figcaption>
		Fig. 37.--Preparing the Boot to receive the Patch.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	the old leather is not taken away,
	as for closing in. In this instance,
	it will only be necessary
	to explain how to put on the oval
	patch, for the rule is the same
	in all other shapes, except where
	the patch has to be sewn down
	to the sole; and instructions for
	doing this are given on p. 35.
	When the patch is skived, lay it
	on the boot, overlapping the worn
	part equally all round, as A A
	(Fig. 37). Now chalk all round
	the edge of the patch, and on the
	old leather as well, as shown, and
	draw a line right across, from C to C, so that you may
	get the piece back into its proper position.
</p>

<p>
	Then skive the surface of the old leather to receive
	the patch, starting at the edge of the chalk mark, and
	skive towards the centre all round, being careful to get
	the work regular. Then roughen both the new and old
	leather with either a file, a piece of coarse sand-paper,
	or a buffing-knife. Lightly brush out all the leather
	dust, and apply the solution with the finger; shake the
	bottle, and give one thin coat both to the patch and old
	leather; let them dry, and then give another thin coat,
	and let this dry. It should dry white; and if it does not
	do so, a little more solution is needed. Care should be
	taken to see that the edge of the patch has taken the
	solution properly, and that the old leather has it only on
</p>

<p>
	[Page 39.]
</p>

<p>
	the roughened part. It may be considered that it would
	be best to solution a patch like Fig. 35 all over, but it
	is not so, as this would make it very stiff, so that it
	would not yield in wear, but perhaps only wrinkle and
	soon work off. The whole of the solutioned surface
	having dried white, warm both parts before a very slow
	fire, and when the whole of the white colour has changed
	to brown, stick the patch on the boot, just as it was
	first fitted; press it on tight, and with a warm iron
	spread a little soft heel-ball all over; let the whole get
	quite cold, then gently rub off the heel-ball, smooth with
	a cloth, and polish with blacking, and it is finished.
</p>

<p>
	If "Warman's Solution" is used, it will be found
	better to keep it in a warm place. Some shoemakers,
	when using this preparation, place the bottle about their
	person; this keeps it in good working condition: the
	heat from the body appears most suitable to the
	ingredients.
</p>

<p>
	The solution will not cling to a smooth surface;
	therefore, when possible, roughen it with a rasp after
	skiving. This accomplished, well shake the solution
	and cover the patch, and likewise the place prepared for
	it; let the solution dry, and repeat until it dries white
	all over. The patch is now ready for sticking, and to do
	this requires a slow fire. If the fire is at all fierce, hold
	the boot and the patch at a considerable distance, or
	they will not hold. When the solution is melted, carefully
	place the patch, taking great care not to let the
	edge go beyond where skived; rather keep it a little
	within; it must be kept free from puckers. Let it
	stand while you get ready your wax-end thread to sew
	the patch down to the sole, or if you do not intend to
	sew it down, allow time to get the solution well set.
	Warm a glazing-iron, and with that smooth your patch
	by working it towards the edge. This has the effect of
	working out from under the patch any air or superfluous
	solution. When this is done, rub your finger over
	the surface, and any solution that may have remained
	can be pressed out. Then ink it over to stain the mark
</p>

<p>
	[Page 40.]
</p>

<p>
	that may be seen round the edge. In the case of brown
	or other coloured leather this must be omitted.
</p>

<p>
	When this operation is accomplished, you have a
	patch that <i>is</i> invisible, and, in addition, will never come
	off. This method has frequently proved successful; but
	simply following the instructions given on the labels of
	the bottles generally ends in failure, and craftsmen
	abandon the practice on that account.
</p>

<p>
	"Blind-stabbing" is another method of repairing boot
	tops, so called from having to find the hole inside a boot,
	where it is impossible to see. Blind-stabbing

<p>
	is one of the most important
	processes in the repairing of boots,
	as all repairs to the tops can be done
	in some form by this means--as
	patches, rips, toe-caps, new springs.
</p>

<p>
	It is very handy when a vamp has
	a small crack in it, which is often the
	case. It can be darned up in two
	ways: first, by using two wax-ends
	and a zigzag stitch from one side
	to the other, as at A (Fig. 38); or by
	making the stitches with one wax-end
	only, as at B. Ihis is the neater way,
	but it needs more care and attention.
</p>

<p>
	In either case it is well to put a piece of leather
	under the crack. It will want skiving at the edge; a
	piece like Fig. 35 would do nicely. It is easy to get
	under if the patch is rolled up and passed through the
	crack, and then levelled by putting an awl through and
	unrolling it, seeing that it is placed exactly under the
	crack.
</p>

<p>
	In darning the patch, set each stitch from B to C
	(Fig. 38), taking hold of no more leather than necessary
	on either side; when this is done the whole length of the
	crack, start stitching backward, making the stitches
	from A to B (Fig. 39), which is a full-size sketch of
	the crack and stitches. This second stitching is to
	draw down the first row of stitches, and so make them
</p>

<p>
	[Page 41.]
</p>

<p>
	look small. A fine wax-end or piece of twist should
	be used, and when this is lightly hammered down, and a
	piece of soft heel-ball rubbed in, it can be scarcely seen.
</p>

<p>
	Fig. 40 illustrates the way to do blind-stabbing. The

	left hand is put inside the boot, one of the bristles being
	held between the thumb and finger, with the point
	of the bristle about level with the tip of the finger. The
	stab-awl, which has a thin straight blade, is held in the
	right band, which at the same time holds the other
</p>

<p>
	[Page 42.]
</p>

<p>
	bristle, E. It is well to first put the two bristles
	together, and halve the thread and give it a twist, as
	at A, so that both ends may be the same length in
	working.
</p>

<p>
	The awl is then put through the leather about

<p>
	half-way the length of the blade, its exact position
	is felt with the finger of the left hand, and the bristle is
	then laid parallel with it, as at B; to steady the hand,
	place the finger against the lining of the boot at C;
</p>

<figure id="Figure042">

	<figcaption>

<p>
	withdraw the awl to within about 1/4 in. of its point,
	pushing up the bristle with it, and letting the bristle lie
	on the flat side of the awl; move the awl and bristle up
	and down, but do not entirely withdraw it until the
	point of the bristle finds its way into the hole with
	the awl. It is quite easy to move the awl up and down
	if the first finger of the right hand is kept on the leather
	at C. When the bristle is in the hole at D, pull it
	through with the right hand, and hold it in the hand
	with the awl, as shown at E. Again put the left hand
	inside the boot with the other bristle; make a second
</p>

[Page 43.]

<p>
	hole, and repeat tlie operations till the bristle is passed
	through. Take the right bristle, E, in the left hand, and
	pull out the left with the right hand, and draw both out
	together the whole length of the thread, pulling some-
	what sharply, and give a final pull to tighten the

<p>
	stitch. This is continued as far as necessary, putting
	from twelve to eighteen stitches to the inch.
</p>

<p>
	The position of the boot in Fig. 44 shows how it
	should be held upon the knees; but while drawing out

<p>
	the thread, it will have to be held fast between the legs,
	according to where the repair is being made.
</p>

<p>
	When it is wanted to sew anywhere towards the toe
	or beyond the reach of the whole hand, shown in Fig. 40,
	the means of doing so is by holding the bristle between
	the first two fingers, as Fig. 41. The bristle is laid
	on the cushion of the second finger, and held there
	with the nail of the first, as shown at A. To blind-stab
	like this is more difficult, but being so useful, it pays
	for the extra trouble. Boys can soon learn to blind-stab,
	as their hands are small: and it is knowledge that
	will always be of use to them.
</p>

<p>
	[Page 44.]
</p>

<p>
	A makeshift method of blind-stabbing is to get an
	8 in. upholsterer's needle (Fig. 42), which is very little
	stouter than an ordinary stout awl, put it in a handle
	(Fig. 43), fit the patch (Fig. 44), if stout leather, such
	as kip. Make holes with awl for light leather; use
	the needle carefully. Pass through with wax-end, draw
	out needle; see that ends of thread are level, thread the
	outside end, pass through second hole, draw out end
	inside boot, thread the inside end, pull out needle;
</p>

<figure id="Figure045">
	<img src="Figures/045.png" />
	<figcaption>
		Fig. 45.--Sole raised to receive Underlay.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	draw both ends tight, and continue till patch is sewn
	round. Work back a couple of stitches, cut off ends,
	and lightly tap with hammer to make the patch lie
	smooth. This method will suit a good many people
	who cannot use the wax-end with bristles. With this
	needle a patch can be sewn on in a quarter the time
	it could be done with wax-ends by a novice.
</p>

<p>
	The minor repairs that have connection with the
	sole or bottom may now be dealt with.
</p>

<p>
	Underlaying is putting a piece under a sole where it
	is worn. Many people wear away the sole very quickly
	on the outside, while a few do just the same on the
	inside; and in either case an underlay in time will often
	save a sole.
</p>

<p>
	This repairing is accomplished sometimes by putting
</p>

<p>
	[Page 45.]
</p>

<p>
	the piece on outside. This is done because it is
	less trouble, but one should spare no pains to do a small
	job well, because it is that alone that will make a large
	one come easy.
</p>

<p>
	To underlay, a last or iron foot must be put inside
	the boot to keep the part that wants repairing quite solid.
	If the boot is machine or hand-sewn, rip it with a knife
	from A to B (Fig. 45), and lift it up as C C. If it is riveted,
	it will have to be prised up with a blunt chisel, and
	the rivets drawn out from A to C and B to C. Cut out a
	wetted piece of good sole leather to the shape of Fig. 46,
	roughly skive it round the curved side, A A A, and then
	push it under the old leather at D (Fig. 45), but not
</p>

</figure>

<p>
	quite as far as it will finally have to go; then trim
	the old leather round from C to C with a knife, not
	taking off much, but all that is weak and thin, and
	being careful not to cut the new leather. This done,
	knock the piece in to where it is wanled--that is, the
	dotted line E--and draw a pencil round the curve cut
	from C to C, to mark the new piece. Take out the piece
	(Fig. 46), and from the line B B and B scoop it out with
	the knife to A A and A, in the same way that is done in
	grafting a half sole, but in that case the old leather has
	to receive the new, and in this the new has to receive
	the old (C C, Fig. 45). Now put the piece in again,
	and put three short rivets in at F, F, F. Trim up the
	edge, leaving it quite full, to allow for graving, rasping,
	etc.
</p>

<p>
	If the boot is hand-sewn, then the underlay must be
	sewn down from A to B, and it will look neater if
	a channel is cut in the new piece to receive the stitch
</p>

<p>
	[Page 46.]
</p>

<p>
	but it may be sewn through in the same way that
	a patch on the upper is sewn down. If the boot is
	riveted or machine-sewn, the underlay can be riveted
	down from A to B, about the same distance from the
	edge, and in a like manner to that shown in Fig. 48;
	and in either case the edge can be knifed, pared, rasped, and
	finished as described on p. 26.
</p>

<p>
	When a boot is worn very badly, the underlay is not
	always enough to make up the edge to the proper
	substance; then a little piece sufficiently thick to fill
	that vacant place can be skived off a piece of hard sole
</p>

<figure id="Figure048">
	<img src="Figures/048.png" />
	<figcaption>

	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	leather, well wetted, somewhat the shape of Fig. 47, put
	under the layer, and riveted or sewn down with it.
</p>

<p>
	Toe-piecing is similar to underlaying, except that it
	is at the toe end of the sole; but everything is fitted
	and done in the same way as shown by A and B (Fig, 48),
	which also shows how the underlays should be nailed
	both on the old and new leather. It is often wise to
	put both an underlay and a toe-piece as well to repair
	a sole, more especially when the boot is old, as it saves
	a whole sole, and uses up odd pieces of leather.
</p>

<p>
	It sometimes happens that the upper leaves the sole
	for some distance along the side of the boot, as from
	A to B (Fig. 49). One way to sew them together again is
	by loop-stitching; the loop, which is inside and draws
	the upper to the sole, can be set at every stitch or each
	alternate one, but take care not to make large holes in
	the upper. To proceed, make a hole with the sewing-awl
	through the sole from A to C, draw the thread
</p>

<p>
	[Page 47.]
</p>

<p>
	through, and halve it; then with a fine stab-awl make a
	hole in the upper; at A put through the right hand end,
	and draw it through inside the boot; make another
	hole at D and draw the end through outside, as shown
	by E. The hole is found inside, as explained in the
	directions for blind-stabbing (p. 41). For such work as
	this, however, it can be done by the stitch-draw, explained
	later on. When thus far, make another hole through
	the sole from D to F; put the left end (C) in first, then
</p>

</figure>

<p>
	the right (E), pull them tight on both sides, and the
	loop-stitch is set.
</p>

<p>
	The seat-stitch is another way. For this a row of
	rather long stitches are set in the upper, from A to B
	(Fig. 50). This can be done with a stout stab-awl and a
	sewing-thread (size about 9 cord of "Patent No. 9"),
	with the stitches quite close to the sole. Then, at A,
	bore through the sole a hole, A C (Fig. 49), being careful to
	make it exactly opposite the centre of the first stitch on
	the upper, A (Fig. 50). Lift up this stitch by putting
	the point of the sewing-awl under. Put an end through
	this stitch and through the hole made in the sole, and
	halve thread as before. This leaves one end in the sole
</p>

<p>
	[Page 48.]
</p>

<p>
	on the left and one through the stitch on the right, as
	at C and D. There are three stitches set to show how
	each stitch is caught up and drawn down; the two loops
</p>

</figure>

<p>
	at E are left loose to illustrate. Each
	stitch must be pulled in quite tight, as
	that is what draws the upper to the
	sole.
</p>

<p>
	The stitch-draw is a ready means of
	finding the hole inside a boot, where
	it cannot be seen. For instance, take the
	fore part of a boot (Fig. 51), and to get
	a bristle through at A from the inside;
	B B B is a spare end of thread, which can
	be put from the outside through the hole
	A, and drawn nearly through; then, some
	little distance away from the bristle (say
	at C), a hole can be made
	through B with a fine
	awl; then take out one
	end of the sewing-thread,
	and put the bristle D
	through the hole C, till
	you get to the junction
	of the bristle
	where the
	thread goes
	between,
	as shown at C;
	then at E pull
	the thread,
	B B B, until
	the bristle D F is through to the outside; take it out of
	B B B, hold it at D with the left hand, while B B B is
	pulled through with the right from the inside. This, it
	will be seen, is blind-stabbing with less learning; and
	although this is very handy, it will prove to be blind
	stabbing with less speed.
</p>

<p>
	To sew on a loose toe-cap, first put a last into the
	boot, double the cap, to find the half or centre. The
</p>

<p>
	[Page 49.]
</p>

<p>
	half of the longest curve of the cap--that is, the part
	that will be sewn down to the sole, is placed exactly
	central on the toe, and a tack is driven through it into
	the sole. The two ends of the toe-cap are then held firm,
	one drawn down tight at either side, and a tack put
	in to keep each corner in its place, seeing first that the
	toe-cap is perfectly straight; otherwise, it will look very
	unsightly when finished. Previous to sewing down,
	drive the toe-cap, with rather a blunt chisel, between
	the upper and the welt. This will enable the sewing
	stitches to be put further back, and make a neater job.

<h3>
	RE-WELTING AND RE-SOLING.
</h3>

<p>
	To re-welt and re-sole hand-sewn boots are certainly the
	two most difficult repairs, they are also the most
	important, being the nearest approach to the making of a
	boot. When, by practising with repairs, skill has been
	attained in using the awl and thread; although the present
	work is the harder, it ought to come easier than some of
	the minor repairs did at an earlier stage. In shoe repairing,
	a week seldom passes without a job of some kind to
	give a little varied practice and keep the hand in trim.
</p>

<p>
	To proceed with the work in hand, a last must
	always be put in and fitted well to the boot or shoe, or
	you will not be able to make them look well, and there
	is a chance of making them smaller. Pieces of stout
	leather can be put on top of the lasts, or even pieces of
	bundle-of-firewood will do, tapered at one end, and
	the thin end knocked in first; but then, this must be
	done carefully, or the vamp may break just in front of
	the lacing. Fitting them up well in this form should
	make the bottom solid all over, and keep them in their
	proper shape.
</p>

<p>
	A thin long tack must be put in the back of the
	boot to keep the last in its place, as at A (Fig. 52). Then
	put the sole and welt part in water, and when wet, take
	out the boot, wipe it, and cut the old sole off. This is
	done by putting a knife between the sole and welt at B,
	and continuing right along, round the toe, and down the
	other side to C. The old sole can then be cut away,
	cutting across from D to E to make a riveted or pegged
	graft, as shown on p. 51, or from F to G to make a sewn
	graft.
</p>

<p>
	In either case a small hole can be made in the old
	leather at H, and a piece of wax-end put through, that it
</p>

<p>
	[Page 51.]
</p>

<p>
	may be drawn down flat on to the top of the heel,
	securing it there by tying the thread round the nail at A.
	This keeps the old sole in position while grafting, and
	while sewing in the welt. If you intend to welt the
	boot all round, carefully cut the old welt away from I to
	J, and temporarily remove the bottom filling, K. The
	next thing is to fit the welt, which is a long strip of
	oil-dressed leather, costing from 1d. per pair. The welt
	must be buffed on the grain side, cut in two straight
</p>

<p>
	down the centre, tied in a loose knot, and put into water
	to get thoroughly soaked; for they have to be used wet.
	Before they are ready for use, an angular piece is taken
	off the grain side, as shown at A (Fig. 53). Grain side
	down, the welt will show an end like Fig. 53, and this is
	the position it is held while being sewn in.
</p>

<p>
	The sewing is done as shown in Fig. 54, starting by
	putting the thread in at A, then halving the thread, and
	making a hole at B, and while the awl is in place the
	welt against the upper at its point, and make a hole in it
	at I. The hole is made as shown by the arrow in Fig. 53.
	First put the bristle in the left hand through, then the
	one in the right, and pull them both out, changing the
	bristles by this means into the other hands, and set the
</p>

<p>
	[Page 52.]
</p>

<p>
	stitch with a final pull. Continue this (as in Fig. 54)
	until the old welt on the other side is reached.
</p>

<p>
	Use a sewing-awl and a thread of about the same
	substance to sew in tlie welt. When this is sewn in, hammer
	the seam down all round, giving firm blows, so as not to
	break or bruise it. Then carefully skive off any stuff
	above the seam that may make it uneven or clumsy, but
	do not cut near the seam stitches to weaken them.
</p>

<p>
	For repairs, it is only necessary to skive the ends at
</p>

<p>
	the waist part of the welt a little thinner after they are
	sewn in. This can, and should, be done first; but a
	novice is apt to make the welt too thin, and weaken it
	where it should be solid, having to stand against the
	splice or graft in the sole. A piece of bone should now
	be rubbed round to make the welt flat to receive the
	stitches with which the sole will have to be stitched on.
	The edge of the welt must now be rounded to the shape
	required. Generally, the proper width for a pair of
	welts is that of the leather when split in two; but
	at places the stitching somewhat contracts it, and thus
	leaves prominent parts, which are best cut off; and, as
	shown by the dotted line in Fig. 54, the welt is always a
	little too wide at the waist.

	If the old bottom tilling is good, paste it in again at

	K (Fig. 52); if not, replace it with new. Felt is used for
	this purpose; cut a piece a little larger than the old,
	and paste down the shank--this is generally a piece
	of skived leather, which reaches from under the heel to
	the dotted line, L (Fig. 52), and just the width of the
	waist. Then paste the new piece of felt in the bottom,
	well hammer it in all over; and when dry skive off
	the edge all round at M M (Fig. 52), making it level with

<p>
	the welt stitch and the centre, K. It is then ready to
	receive the sole.
</p>

<p>
	But if you intend to make a sewn graft, this graft
	must be made prior to placing the sole down. To
	do this, it is important to have the old leather
	cut straight across, and straight through from A to A
	(Fig. 55), and the same with the new sole from B to B.
	Then draw a line from C to C about 3/8 in. from the edge,
	and about 1/8 in. from this a second one from D to D.
</p>

<p>
	From D to D on the first line cut in the leather a
	groove about 1/16 in. deep, but not going through, holding
	the knife quite upright; this cut can then be opened with
	any blunt instrument, to show the depth of it. Then
	from this channel cut away one side towards the toe to
</p>

<p>
	[Page 54.]
</p>

<p>
	the second line, C C, holding the knife quite slanting.
	This is to make a channel, as shown at E, to receive the
	stitches, and so make a flat sunk seam to the graft.
</p>

<p>
	Make a series of holes (about five to the inch) from
	D to D with a sewing-awl, placing the point on the
	bottom of the channel, and pushing it until the point
	comes through the edge of the leather, B B, about 1/16 in.
	from the grain side. All this should be done on the flesh
	side, with the leather fitted in the same way as shown
	on page 24, with the exception that, this being sewn
	work, the leather has to be used a little wetter.
</p>

<p>
	The boot is now put across the knees, in the position
	shown in Fig. 52, with the toe towards the left and the
	back part towards the right knee, and--as also shown in
	the illustration--with the old waist tied back. The
	new sole can be put against the old leather, and an old
	rasp, N, put along the top, as shown, and the strap
	or rope, O, placed round the waist of the boot, as
	shown, and passing over the rasp. The strap will, as
	it is pressed by the worker's foot upon the shank, L, the
	old waist, H, and the new sole, P, keep them all solid
	while the graft is being sewn. A strong thread--about
	fifteen strands of No. 9 Patent, or its equivalent of
	stouter hemp--should be used, and plenty of wax should
	be worked into the thread before it is twisted.
</p>

<p>
	The sewing should commence at the upper end in
	Fig. 55, and continue across to the lower, tying a small
	but firm knot, as shown at F, as each end of the seam
	must be particularly solid. For this reason it is well
	to make two short threads, using one for each graft: this
	is better than starting and ending with a knot. Novices
	wear out a thread quicker than experienced workmen
	do, as they handle it more, and pull it through
	with occasional jerks. Even at the expense of neatness,
	this seam Tnust be made solid; this cannot so well be
	attained in riveted work.
</p>

<p>
	This grafting is done with the piece on the top of the
	heel, according to tbe position of the old leather, as will
	be seen in Fig. 52. This is the most convenient plan.

<p>
	and the old top-piece of the heel provides a flat surfaceto work upon.
</p>

<p>
	If it is found difficult to keep the sole firmly in
	position by means of the rasp only, a long rivet can
	be put in through into the old lifts at H, and another at
	P (Fig. 52). The heeling should be left till the soling is
	done, and the two holes can be rubbed out in the
	finishing.
</p>

<p>
	After the graft is sewn the whole of the bottom, K
	and L; the new sole, P, and the old shank, H, should

<p>
	have a thin coat of paste. The sole can now be put
	into its place, and pulled towards the toe to keep it
	in position. A rivet is put through at A (Fig. 56), and
	another through the hole, P, in Fig. 52.
</p>

<p>
	This done, hammer the sole evenly all over, and
	then pare it all round the edge, close to the welt, as
	shown at B B (Fig. 56). As the sole is wet, with a little
	care this can be done easily without cutting the upper
	part, and should form one even edge all round, kept
	square or at right angles with the flat of the sole, taking
	care not to go too close to the welt. A line can now be
	drawn all round with the compasses, about 1/16 in. from
	the edge; and upon this line the channel is to be cut to
	receive the stitch.
</p>

<p>
	The boot is held sole upwards between the knees,with
</p>

<p>
	[Page 56.]
</p>

<p>
	the toe towards you; and to cut the channel, use a
	sharp-pointed knife, held near the point between the thumb and
	finger, letting the second finger rest upon the edge of the
	sole. The knife will be somewhat in the position of a pen
	while writing; but it must be held firmly, and it should
	form an angle of about 50° with the flat of the welt.
	The channel should be cut through the grain and into
	the fibrous and wear-resisting part of the sole deep
	enough to let the thread lie well below the surface.
	This will be nearly half-way through the leather,
	whatever its thickness may be, as it is the substance of
	the sole that wdll govern the thickness of the thread,
	which will have to lie in the channel. The thread being
	thus embedded in the firm part of the sole gives solidity
	to the stitching, and leaves the grain free to form a
	covering for the stitch.
</p>

<p>
	When the cut has been made (Fig. 56) from B round
	the toe to C, it can be opened with any blunt instrument.
	This is so that you may see the point of the awl
	when it comes out in the pit or centre of the channel,
	and also to give space for the stitch to fall into. To
	prevent the stitcliing-awl from notching the inner edge
	of the channel, which would make it irregular
	and unsightly when finished, it can be turned over
	for about two inches; and when about a dozen stitches
	have been made, pass the left-hand thumb-nail along the
	channel from the last stitch, and turn over for another
	two inches.
</p>

<p>
	Stitching on the sole is generally done when a boot
	has been welted; and before this, the waist will have to be
	sewn down. It does not matter about a channel being
	cut in the old waist leather, as this can be blacked: which
	helps to hide the stitch; though if the leather is
	sufficiently thick to admit of a channel, this will make a
	neater finish.
</p>

<p>
	The sewing is started at D (Fig. 56), and the sewing-awl
	(Fig. 57) is used till the first stitch on the new
	leather is reached at B; then the stitching-awl (Fig. 58)
	is used. At the two points, B and C, the sewing and
</p>

<p>
	[Page 57.]
</p>

<p>
	stitching should be so arranged that a stitch extends
	across the graft from the old to the new leather at B, and
	from the new to old at C, so as to make these weakest
	points quite solid.
</p>

<p>
	The technical meaning of sewing is that two or more
	pieces are held together, and shoemakers call all work
	sewn that is treated with a round awl; while stitching
	is only technically applied where the square awl is used.
</p>

<p>
	The stitching-awl is put into the same sort of handle,
</p>

<figure id="Figure057">
	<img src="Figures/057.png" />
	<figcaption>
		Fig. 57.--Sewing-awl.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	and is a similar tool to the sewing-awl, with the exception
	of being flat (as shown in Fig. 58); and it is now
	almost generally known as the square awl. From this
	figure it will be seen that when put into the handle the
	stitching-awl has a double curve. This makes it more
</p>

<figure id="Figure058">
	<img src="Figures/058.png" />
	<figcaption>
		Fig. 58.--Blade of Stitching-awl.
</p>

<p>
	handy to get into awkward places, and pressure on the
	handle gives a power that could not otherwise be
	obtained. The action of this awl is peculiar; it must
	not be wriggled about in the same manner as the
	sewing-awl; and in use it must be passed through by
	one rapid and almost straight push.
</p>

<p>
	The boot is held by the strap on the knees, toe towards
	you, on its side, with the sole to the left, and the upper
	to the right. The thumb of the left hand is pressed firmly
	against the bottom of the sole, as shown by E in Fig.56,
	just beyond where the point of the awl is to comeout.
	The awl is then laid against the upper, with the point on
	the flat of the welt, and it is pushed through. One
	sharp push, at the same time dropping the elbow a little,
</p>

<p>
	[Page 58.]
</p>

<p>
	sends the point through the leather into the channel cut
	in the new sole, as shown at B B (Fig. 59).
</p>

<p>
	A good idea of how a hand-made boot is put together
	can be gained by careful examination of Fig. 59. It
	shows a boot cut through at the centre of the sole.
	The various parts are lettered as follows: A, stitching-awl;
	B B, channel cut for stitches; C, sole; D, upper
</p>

<figure id="Figure059">

	<figcaption>

	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	leather; E E, space for foot; F,
	in-sole; G F, welt stitch; H H,
	welt.
</p>

<p>
	The stitching is continued
	round as far as the new leather
	goes; the old leather is then
	sewn, as was done on the opposite
	side. The channel is again
	opened, and the stitches within
	it are well rubbed down with the
	bone. A little paste is rubbed
	in all round with a piece of rag
	put over the right thumb-nail,
	which is put in the channel, and
	passed all round the channel in
	the sole.
</p>

<p>
	The raised edge of the channel
	is rasped away with an old file,
	taking strokes outward from the
	centre of the sole, the boot being held in the left hand,
	with the heel towards you. The file strokes proceed,
	as shown by the arrow at A B (Fig. 60), towards the toe,
	and are continued all round.
</p>

<p>
	The boot is then replaced in the same position as at
	first, and the ridge over the channel is rubbed hard up
	and down with a bone or long stick, held with one end
	in each hand, as shown from C to D in Fig. 60, until the
	whole is smoothed. By these means the thin narrow
	strip of grain, H (Fig. 56), is thrown towards the edge,
	where it forms a burr all round. The boot is then held
	with the toe towards you. With the back of the knife the
	edge of the sole is scraped upwards, to throw this burr
</p>

<p>
	[Page 59.]
</p>

<p>
	over the face of the sole. The knife is then held flat on
	to the sole, and the burr cut off level with the face. The
	stitches on the welt side are then rubbed down a little
	with the tapered bone, whetting a little with the mouth
</p>

<p>
	while using it.
	The sole is then
	well and evenly
	hammered all
	over.
</p>

<p>
	As the stitch is
	wanted to ehow
	up boldly on the
	welt, the
	fudge-wheel (Fig. 61)
	should be run
	round it before the stitching is commenced. This wheel
	makes an impression on the leather resembling stitching,
	and the real stitching will appear regular if the
	awl is put through exactly in the wheel-marks. To get

<figure id="Figure061">
	<img src="Figures/061.png" />
	<figcaption>
		Fig. 61.--Fudge-wheel.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	a bold and even stitch,
	the principal factor is a
	mode of setting the
	stitch. Each time that
	the awl is taken out,
	put in the left-hand
	bristle first, as usual,
	and in putting in the
	other bristle, on the right
	side, let it pass on top of
	the stitch up towards
	the first. This will throw up the stitch towards
	the edge; and if carefully done with each one, the
	stitches will show one straight line. The stitches
	can be set from 12 to 16, or even 18, to the inch,
	according to the style of work; 14 will do well
	forordinary repairs.
</p>

<p>
	After the stitches are rubbed down, the warmed
	fudge-wheel can be carefully run round the sole, each
	cog to go between each stitch. This will prick up the
	stitch; or a prick-stitch can be used between each stitch.
</p>

<p>
	[Page 60.]
</p>

<p>
	The boots are then finished in the way described in
	Chap. VIII.
</p>

<p>
	To make a thread for either stitching or sewing, flax
	or hemp is used. This is sold in balls ready for casting
	and twisting, and should always be drawn from the
	inner end. It is convenient to place the ball in a box
	and draw the thread through a hole. The thread is
	first broken at about 6 in. from the end to the form
	shown at A (Fig. 62). This is done by rolling it on
</p>

<figure id="Figure062">
	<img src="Figures/062.png" />
	<figcaption>

<p>
	the right thigh
	with a long
	sweep of the
	right hand. This
	action untwists
	the fibres, as at
	B, and a smart
	jerk with the
	left hand parts
	the threads,
	leaving the flossy
	ends as shown at A;
	the short
	end is thrown
	away.
</p>

<p>
	The length of thread commonly used is about three
	yards, and several pieces of about this leogth are broken
	from the ball. For stitching purposes the thread ranges
	from about 5 to 9 strands, and for sewing-up to about 15
	strands. At C is shown the end of a thread having 8
	strands, and it will be noticed that these ends are
	placed at different places, lengthways, so as to form a
	tapering end to the threads when all are twisted together.
</p>

<p>
	Having broken off the requisite number of strands,
	they are hooked midway of their length over a nail and
	twisted by rolling on the knee in the way described for
	breaking the strand. About a dozen sweeps of the hand
	should suffice for each end. The whole thread is then
	held at full length to allow the twisting to distribute
	itself evenly, and wiped smooth with a cloth.
</p>

<p>
	[Page 61.]
</p>

<p>
	Waxing the thread is the next process, and to do this
	follow the plan shown in Fig. 62, where L is the left
	hand and R the right. The thread is wound round the
	left hand leaving a length of about 2 ft. for waxing with
	the wax, marked W, and held in the right hand as shown.
	The thread is laid in the wax and held firmly upon it by
	the thumb, T, and waxed by drawing the hands apart;
	this is repeated a few times, as may be necessary. The
	thread is then unwound from the left hand, and another
	length of about 2 ft. is waxed.
</p>

<p>
	Select a good pair of bristles to go on each end of
</p>

<p>
	the thread; cut off the
	bulby part from one
	end by a slanting cut
	as at D. At E, bend
	both bristles across the
	thumb-nail, and split
	them to this point by
	tearing asunder the
	bushy part of the hair at F. Place the tapered end
	of the waxed thread between the two split portions, and
	carefully plait the whole together. Finally, a hole is
	made with a fine awl at E, and the point of the bristle is
	threaded through it; this secures the join against
	unplaiting. A bristle may be twisted on by rolling the
	fine-tapered point of the thread round it.
</p>

<p>
	In order to draw the stitches tight in sewing, a
	hand-leather (Fig. 63) is indispensable. It is easily made
	from a piece of old leather, and its dimensions are from
	about 8 in. to 10 in. long, and 2-1/2 in. to 3 in. wide. The
	shape is shown in the illustration; the leather is folded
	at the dotted lines, B C, and F E, and the ends are laced
	together at I J. In the position indicated at A a hole is
	made, about 1 in. diameter, for the thumb to pass through,
	the short strokes at B, D, and e show where the leather
	is snipped. The ends G and H are laced together as
	shown at I J, and the leather is placed on the left hand
	with the lapped ends in the palm and the thumb passing
	through the hole A.

	CHAPTER IV.

<h3>
	BOOT MAKING.
</h3>

<p>
	In making a pair of boots or shoes, the lasts are the first
	requirements; and these cannot be done without. To know
	the size wanted, it is necessary to take the measurement
	of each foot. To do this, place a sheet of paper on the
	floor or any smooth surface, then let the person stand
	full weight upon it, and draw on the paper an outline of
	the foot, being careful to hold the pencil quite upright,
	especially at the toe, D, and heel, C (Fig. 64). Then,
</p>

<figure id="Figure064">
	<img src="Figures/064.png" />
	<figcaption>
		Fig. 64. --Shape of Foot Drawn on Paper.
	</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
	to show the curvature of the waist, draw a second and
	third line, as A and B. It is customary to take the
	length of the foot with a size-stick, but as the only use
	for this tool is to measure the last, it is not necessary to
	give an illustration of it. A size-stick is in the form of a
	rule, and has at one end an upright at right angles, and
	another to slide along so that it can be set to the top of
	the toe to indicate the length on the foot, as the stick
	is pressed against the sole of the foot and the fixed
	upright at the back of the heel.
</p>

<p>
	Fig. 65 represents a shoemaker's penny tape measure;
	on one side it has inches, and on the other sizes which
	are three to an inch. With this tape take the length
	of the draft from C to D (Fig. 64), and, supposing it to
	measure size 5 (A 5's last measures just 10 in.), you will
</p>

<p>
	[Page 63.]
</p>

<p>
	need a last size 7. The length taken with a size-stick,
	with the foot off the ground, would have shown size 4,
	but a 7's would have been needed just the same. This
	proves that the joints in the toes elongate in walking
</p>

<figure id="Figure065">

	<figcaption>

<p>
	and it shows the necessity of having the boot or shoe
	longer than the foot. When the length of the foot has
	been ascertained, it should be marked upon the drawing.
</p>

<p>
	The next measurement to be taken is the joint; and
	this should be done in inches. The tape must encircle
</p>

<p>
	the whole joint, and be drawn only just tight; it must
	pass under the foot at E E (Fig. 64), and over the great
	toe joint and knuckle of the little toe, A B (Fig. 66). This
	measurement is then marked on the draft, and so with
	each until all are taken. Take the second joint, C D
	(Fig. 66), passing round the larger parts of the ball of the
	foot. Next the instep, E F (Fig. 66), letting the tape
	pass under the hollow of the inside waist, E, across the
	bone marked F in Fig. 64, and the instep bone, F. The
	heel measure is taken, passing round (G) the extremity of
	heel, under the ankle bone (H), and across the throat of
</p>

<p>
	[Page 64.]
</p>

<p>
	the foot (I). The leg measure is taken about 1-1/2 in.
	above the ankle bone (H), and encircling the leg from
	J to J.
</p>

<p>
	The measurements generally taken are those shown

<p>
	In fitting up the last to the measures taken, if the
	boots are wanted to be a good and not an easy fit for a

	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	gentleman's foot, one neither very bony nor very fat, let
	the last be exactly the same measure as that of the foot.
	For a lady's foot, the last will need to be about half a
	size--that is, one-sixth of an inch--smaller than the
	measure at the joints and instep, unless the boots are
	wanted very easy. If wanted easy for gentlemen's boots,
	make them about half a size over the measure. For all
	children's work about a quarter size over the measure
	must be taken.
</p>

<p>
	[Page 65.]
</p>

<p>
	German-made lasts can now be got at prices ranging
	from 9d. to 2s. per pair, according to whether they are
	ladies', gent's, or children's sizes. These lasts are often
	not of good shape, but those of four or five fitting
	have nearly always enough stuff to allow of their being
	trimmed down to make a good-shaped last. Select a
	last the toe of which is as nearly as possible the shape
	required, then place it on the sketch of the foot, and see
	if the lines of construction are similar in both, and if
	the girths are right.
</p>

<p>
	The dotted lines in Fig. 68 indicate the parts of these
	lasts that are usually faulty; but with a little skill and
</p>

<figure id="Figure069">
	<img src="Figures/069.png" />
	<figcaption>
		Fig. 69.--Bottom of Last.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	trouble the superfluous material can soon be removed
	with a good rasp. In doing this, the bottom of the lasts
	should be shaped as in Fig. 69. This method will save
	the trouble and expense of having a pair made by the
	last maker, and a really good shape can be got to match
	the shape of your foot by yourself as well as by anyone
	else; you then take the credit of making the boot and
	also of fitting the last, and this will give you confidence
	to fit a pair to any other person's foot.
</p>

<p>
	Fig. 68 shows the proper shape of a last--it is not
	rounded too much at the bottom (A), nor does it project
	too much at B or C. A round bottom will make the toe
	turn up, and, while the boot is being worn, will cause
	undue strain on certain parts of the front or vamp part.
	Too much stuff at B will tend to throw the heel of the
	boot too far back, and also make it higher at the waist
	(D) than at the back, as shown by the two lines B and D.
	If the last has the dotted part at the heel rasped off, the
</p>

<p>
	[Page 66.]
</p>

<p>
	heel can be built all round in proportion, as shown by D
	and E. The disadvantage of a last being too prominent
	at C is that it makes the toe of the upper exceedingly
	difficult to last in.
</p>

<p>
	In Fig. 69 will be seen three shapes for toes; but the
	shape of the toe should make no difference in the
	construction of the last. No matter what the shape of the
	last is to be, space must be given for the great toe, or a
	bunion will be the result. It will be seen by comparison

<p>
	with Fig. 64 that the bottom of the last (Fig. 69) is
	designed to suit the requirements of the foot as it is
	drawn on the sheet of paper (Fig. 64).
</p>

<p>
	Should the last be a little too small in the fitting
	(girth), or should larger boots be wanted to allow for
	thicker stockings, or even boots for a foot larger than
	the last is made for, a set of ordinary fittings will be
	found very handy. These are best made from flank
	ends of the leather, which is the softest part of crop
	belly, and cheap, because it is not much use for any other
	purpose. The leather must be well wetted, stretched
	with a pair of pincers, and cut out roughly to the shapes
	of Figs. 70, 71, 72, and 73. By carefully tacking these
	fittings on to a small last a larger last can be made of
	as good a shape as the original. Fig. 70 is called a

<p>
	long leather (abbreviated L. L.); Fig. 71, an instep
	leather (abbreviated In.); Fig. 72, joint leather
	(abbreviated J.); Fig. 73, heel-pin (abbreviated H.-p.). Before
	being fitted to the last they should be skived thin to
	the edge; then while wet tack them on the last in their
	proper position, as indicated by the figures 1, 2, 3, and 4
	in Fig. 74.
</p>

<p>
	Each piece must be put on the last separately and
	allowed to dry before it is taken off in order to block it to

	taking care not to destroy the block or shape. Each piece
	must be served the same way. For facility in booking

	in Fig. 74. Supposing a last, numbered X for reference,

	it as 7's, No. -- bare; if used with
	heel-pin, toe-pin, and one long
	leather, book it 7's, No. --, H.-p.,
	In., and No. 1, L.L., and so on for any fittings. Bunion
	pieces should be pegged on with fine 1/2 in. pegs. The
	leather must be put on wet, and pegged so that it can
	be skived down all round smooth to the last, leaving
	an even projection to the shape desired. To put in
	these pegs, a hole must be made with a peg-awl (Fig.
	75) as deep as the peg is long, the peg being driven
	home with one blow from the hammer.
</p>

<p>
	An old shoe that is well worn to the shape of the
	foot will be found the safest guide to fit the last up to.

<p>
	the old shoe, cut this round, to admit of the leather
	spreading out to the shape of the last about to be put in.
	If needed, rasp the last till it just fits in the shoe. Try
	the old shoe again on the foot, and chalk mark where it
	in any way hurts; replace the last, and with a fine awl
	prick these marks through into the last, then put pieces
	of wet leather on the last at these points, and make room
	for corns. The last should be as big as the measure--a
	sixth of an inch larger at the joint--if the shoes are
	wanted very easy. A last placed inside an old shoe
	soon shows if it is of the size and the shape to suit your
	tread. A piece for a corn or bunion can soon be added
	anywhere by pegging on a piece of leather. The exact
	spot for such a piece is readily found while the last
	is in the shoe; if the last is deficient at any part, the
	leather of the old shoe will be baggy. An awl pierced
	through it into the last will show exactly the place
	where room is wanted, and where you will need to make
	the last larger.
</p>

<p>
	Iron lasts can be fitted up as explained for wood
	lasts. If the dealers have not got any to suit you,
	it is necessary to have holes drilled where you wish to
	nail the fittings. These holes must be plugged with
	wood to receive the nails. This is the best way; but
	if put on wet, and bound on till dry, some fittings can
	befixed by Le Page's fish glue. Buy the iron lasts under
	the required measure, and fit them up afterwards to what
	is wanted. Iron lasts used for riveted work ought not
	to get rusty, as the leather for such work does not need
	to be worked damp. It should be properly wetted and
	hammered out, and then allowed to get so dry that it is
	only just mellow. Even in repairing it is not wise to
	sodden the leather too much before working upon it. If
	boots have been soaked by accident, or from having been
	worn in the wet and only just taken off the feet, they
	should not be worked upon until the leather is at least
	half-dry, or they will be knocked all out of shape. Any
	portion of the lasts likely to come into contact with wet
	leather could be covered with paper--either waterproof
</p>

<p>
	[Page 69.]
</p>

<p>
	packing-paper or that which buttermen use as a first
	cover for butter; or, failing these, ordinary thin brown
	paper.
</p>

<p>
	Wood lasts must be used in making pegged work, as
	the peg-awl must go through all the materials, and
	a little way into the last. This is so that the peg shall
	go through, and be rubbed down inside by the use
	of the peg-rasp and peg-knife. Iron lasts would blunt
	the awl each time it made a hole, and as the peg
	could not go through all the layers of leather, solidity
	would not result.
</p>

<p>
	Iron lasts are used for riveted boots, as the rivets are
	clenched as they reach the last. They are fitted up
	according to their particular constructions, and a joint
	or long-leather can be easily fixed with a wax-end to
	the last before putting it on the last. Of course,
	the leather must be fitted and blocked to shape on the
	last first. Or another, and the better, way is to have
	holes drilled in the last where fittings are wanted
	to be fitted on. These holes can be plugged with
	gutta-percha or wood, and the fittings nailed to the
	plugs. Plaster casts are sometimes taken, so that the
	customer leaves a model of his foot for the shoemaker to
	adapt a last of wood to the requirements of that foot.
	To make plaster casts of a foot, it must be oiled, and
	a mould taken first.
</p>

<p>
	In choosing the materials, it should be remembered
	that a boot, like a house, depends upon the foundation,
	for which reason the leather should be good of its class,
	and every care exercised to fit it properly. Fig. 76 is
	a top or upper for a gent's lace (or Balmoral) boot, and
	the technical name for each piece is given. For light
	work the quarters are cut from calf-kid, levant, seal,
	memel, calf, etc., and the vamps, golosh, and toe-cap,
	are cut from French calf, krup, patent, etc. For stouter
	work, English calf, porpoise, etc., are used; for very
	heavy best work, memel, cow-hide, stout porpoise,
	neat's, etc. For rough working kip is employed. There
	are many kinds of uppers other than that shown

<p>
	in Fig. 76, such as button, elastic. Bluchers, Derby
	Balmorals, etc. Shoe uppers, as shown in Fig. 77, are
	termed Oxford shoes. There are button shoes, elastic
	shoes, tie shoes, etc.
</p>

<p>
	The leather for the bottoms of a pair of boots or shoes
	is called a set of stuff, and consists of insoles, outward
	soles, welts, stiffeners, shank pieces, side linings, felt, and,
	according to height of heel, lifting and top-pieces. A

<p>
	heel about an inch high is made up of the sole, the split-lift,
	three whole lifts, and a top-piece; and for each additional
	1/8 in. required, add one whole lift. The cost of a
	gent's medium-sized "set" should be about as follows:
	Insoles, cut from shoulder, 5d.; a pair of long outer
	soles. 1s. 6d. These should be cut from English butt
	leather, a pale nut brown, neither very yellow nor very
	red, these coloured leathers being foreign. The English
	leather should have a very fine grain, it being a thin
	layer only, and the fibrous tissues of the true skin should
	be very firm, close, fine, and of a nut-brown colour.
	Gent's soles are cut in one piece, called squares
	whereas ladies' soles, which are also cut in one piece,
	are called springs. Welts consist of a long strip of
	oil-dressed leather about 3/4 in. wide, and cost from l-1/2d.

<p>
	to 2d. per pair; women's cost 1d. Stiffeners, cut from
	shoulder or middle, cost 3d.; lifting pieces, from first cut
	of butt leather, about 6d. for three pairs; top-pieces for
	the heels must be of good solid butt leather, like that
	for the soles: a pair cost 4d. Gent's soles are not cut
	long enough to go through to the heel, so a piece of sole
	leather is required to splice on to them; it need not be
	of very good quality, and with the side-linings will cost
	about 3d. These prices must serve only as a guide, for
	much will depend upon the class of boots or shoes to
	be made.

<p>
	dry, buff, and hammer it, preparatory to using it, is as
	follows:--Put the insoles, outer soles, stiffeners, lifts,
	and top-pieces in a pan of clean water, letting the water
	cover them. With a pair of compasses mark straight
	down the centre of the welts, and cut them so that both
	sides are the same width; tie them up in a knot, and
	put them in the water. When all the pieces are perfectly
	wet through, they should be laid in a draught--not near
	a fire--to dry, with the exception of the welts, which
	have to be used wet.
</p>

<p>
	The insoles require to dry whilst fixed on the last.
	They must be marked with the sewing-awl to the shape
	of the last, then cut out, and while still wet the grain
	side is buffed or scraped, and the insole tacked grain side
	down on the bottom of the last with four tacks in the
	middle, as A, A, A, and A, shown in Fig. 69, p. 65. The
</p>

<p>
	[Page 72.]
</p>

<p>
	sides should then be stretched all round with a pair of
	pincers, and the leather tacked down to keep it tight
	to the bottom of the last till nearly dry; this is called
	blocking the insoles.
</p>

<p>
	The outer soles should dry till they are only just mellow;
	then lightly buff off the grain, and skive off the
	thin layer of flesh or dressing from the back, and do the
	same with the lifts and top-pieces. Sit upon a low
	stool, and place the lap-iron face upwards on the thighs,
	just above the knees; hold the leather grain side
	downwards, and, commencing from the centre, hammer it all
	over. Let each stroke be even, straight, and firm:
</p>

<p>
	strike with the face of the hammer, and do not bruise
	the leather. Leather is hammered to make the fibrous
	tissues more dense, and thus less pervious to damp,
	and offering more resistance to wear. The lifts do not
	want to be hammered so hard as the soles and top-pieces.
</p>

<p>
	When the insoles are nearly dry, carefully take out
	the tacks from the edge, and with a knife round up each
	to the shape of the last. At the waist the insole must
	be trimmed narrower than the last, as shown at B B(Fig. 78),
	where the dotted lines, A A, represent the last.
</p>

<p>
	To make the awl work better in making the holes,
	rub a little soap all over the leather. With a pair of
	compasses draw a marginal line the whole way round
	the sole from 1/4 in. to 1/3 in. from the edge, and by
	drawing the two cross lines C and D, divide the sole into
	three: the heel (1), the waist (2), and the fore part(3).
	The margin should be a little wider at the middle of
</p>

<p>
	[Page 73.]
</p>

<p>
	waist, B B, particularly on the inside, the ends flowing into
	the regular line. The smartness of the waist depends
	upon this sweeping curve. According to the range and
	pitch of the last, see p. 103, the width of margin should
	be increased at the heel (Fig. 78). The more dead the
	last is in the waist, the more the heel will want
	under-seating: that is, to prevent the heel, when it has been

	built, from pitching on the breast, it will want to be
	feathered wide and sewn under at E, and feathered
	narrow and sewn full at F and F. This marginal line,
	when got to its proper shape, must be cut into the
	leather to about one-third of its thickness, the knife
	being held perpendicularly to the sole. This cut must
	be opened with a prick-stitch tool (Fig. 79). The whole

	of the narrow strip of leather is cut away, and this
	leaves the feather as shown in Fig. 80. It is of even
	substance all round the fore part, and of about two-thirds
	the original thickness of the insole leather. At the waist
	this can be thinner, and tapered towards the edge.
</p>

<p>
	To hole this insole, make a new line on the face of
	the leather gauged from the feather about the same
	distance, and in the same way as that drawn from the
	edge for the cut in the feather. Put the sewing-awl
	through at this line, and bring the point out on the edge
	of the feather, as at A A in Fig. 80, which shows a
	transverse section of the insole and the feather, B B.
	After it is fitted carefully, take the insole off the last,
	and with a sharp knife take off the sharp edge of the

<p>

<p>
	arris all round on the grain side, but not cutting away
	so much as to destroy the feather. Sometimes it is
	sufficient to scrape this sharp edge, and it can be
	removed by running the knife round while the insole is on
	the last; but this needs more skill. If this sharp angle

<p>
	The stiffeners should be of good leather, and used
	wet, that they may dry hard. Fig. 81 shows their shape.

	measuring the tops. They must be skived all round on
	both sides, but not much on the grain side, or the

	leather should be skived or tapered to a feather edge,

<h3>
	LASTING THE UPPER.
</h3>

<p>
	When the inner soles are fitted, blocked, holed, etc.,
	on the lasts, they are ready to receive the tops. Select
	the best of these for each particular foot. Much of
	the beauty of a boot or shoe depends upon the maker
	thoroughly mastering the principles of lasting.
</p>

<figure id="Figure084">
	<img src="Figures/084.png" />
	<figcaption>
		Fig. 84.--Ready for Lasting.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	The upper should be laced up as far as the bend or
	throat, where the eyelets finish and the hooks start, to
	prevent it gaping open while being lasted and sewn. The
	stiffener H (Fig. 84) can be pasted on both sides, and put
	into the upper between the lining and the leather, the
	centre against the back seam of the golosh.
</p>

<p>
	Place the last upon your knees, with the heel
	to the left and the toe to the right, inner sole
	downwards. Place the upper over the last, and with the
	right hand pull it down at the toe; get the back seam
	exactly in the centre of the last at the back, where the
</p>

<p>
	[Page 76.]
</p>

<p>
	upper covers only about two-thirds of the last, as shown
	at D (Fig. 84). This is called "horsing," or hoisting the
	back of the heel, and enables the boot to be lasted more
	forward. This will throw a draft into it which would
	be very hard to get by the use of the pincers only.
	Turn the last bottom upwards, hold the toe firmly with
	the right hand, place the heel between the knees,
</p>

<figure id="Figure085">

		Fig. 85.--Sole of Last Showing Tacks.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	change the left hand for the right at the toe, and, with
	the pincers in the right hand, very tightly draw the toe
	of the upper over the toe of the last, taking care that
	the back seam and centre of the vamp and toe are quite

<figure id="Figure086">
	<img src="Figures/086.png" />
	<figcaption>

<p>
	straight on the last. With the left hand hold the upper
	firmly where you have pulled it, place the forefinger on
	the spot where the pincers are, and hold the leather
	there till you can put in the first tack at A (Fig. 85).
	Fig. 86 shows a lasting tack--3/4 in. shoemaker's rivets
	will answer the purpose for light or medium work, but
	Scotch tacks are best. This plan of the sole of the last
	(Fig. 85) has each tack marked in alphabetical order, to
	show which is the proper order to put them in. The
	leather is then pulled over, and tacks put in at B and B,
	working in reasonable and equal portions of stuff between
	each two neighbouring tacks. All tacks used in lasting
	are put right through all materials, and are driven into
</p>

<p>
	[Page 77.]
</p>

<p>
	the last far enough to keep the work solid; for although
	they are there only temporarily, they have to remain till
	the stitch takes their place in the sewn boot.
</p>

<p>
	If the upper is quite straight upon the last, the two
	tacks next to be put in are C and C (Figs. 84 and 85).
	These are draft tacks, so called because they put and keep
	a draft in the boot or shoe. This draft is got by pulling
	hard with the pincers in the direction shown by the
	line E E (Fig. 84). To get this draft the upper is hoisted
	at the back as already mentioned; when the whole of
	the fore part is lasted, the back or heel of the last is
	knocked down into its place, and it must necessarily
	form a line of tension at E E, and it is this tension
	which is called draft.
</p>

<p>
	The main principles to be observed are tightness
	in lasting, drafting out of all the wrinkles and pipes
	around the toe, equal strain at all parts, and uniformity
	on both sides. It is this evenness in lasting which
	gives the finished boot a good appearance and makes
	it set nicely. A boot that is lasted properly when the
	last is out will look as shapely as it was before the
	last had been withdrawn.
</p>

<p>
	The side linings (Fig. 83) are now put in between the
	lining and outside leather, they are not pasted, and their
	position is indicated by the dotted line F, Fig. 84. The
	two tacks D and D can now be put in to hold the
	side lining firm; while lasting up the sides or round the
	heel, always see that the lining is lasted tightly;
	otherwise, when the boot, is finished, the lining will set in
	puckers and hurt the foot.
</p>

<p>
	It will be seen in Fig. 84 that the top leather does not
	touch the last at G; but it must be lasted, first on one
	side and then on the other, until all this fulness is got
	away, or the work will be too large when finished.
</p>

<p>
	When all the tacks are driven in the fore half as
	far as E E (Fig. 85), the heel of the last can be knocked
	into the upper until the bottom of the golosh is just
	above the insole, for at the heel seats it does not need
	much to last over. The waist and seat can now be lasted
</p>

<p>
	[Page 78.]
</p>

<p>
	similarly to the fore part, but here the leather need not
	be pulled so hard, especially at the waist. In the case
	of a shoe it will only be necessary to pull over the
	leather with the thumb and finger, or all the draft may
	be pulled from the quarters (see Fig. 76), which would
	make them baggy at the sides in wear. The boot is
	now lasted, with the exception of the toe.
</p>

<p>
	In lasting stout, heavy leather it is likely to either
</p>

<figure id="Figure087">
	<img src="Figures/087.png" />
	<figcaption>
		Fig. 87.--Lasting the Toe.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	set away from the last or form itself into wrinkles at
	the heel, and even up the sides. All these wrinkles
	or pipes must be got clear away before commencing
	to sew in the seat or the welt. The toe is a portion
	that will always form itself into wrinkles, and special
	instructions for dealing with this are given. The other
	parts will not need so much humouring, though their
	treatment is exactly the same.
</p>

<p>
	"Pipes" and "wrinkles" are technical terms used in
	lasting; they mean the hills and valleys that leather
	will form itself into where there is surplus stuff, and
	this fulness must be lasted away as explained. If
	when the toe is lasted as far as shown in Fig. 87 a
	V-shaped piece of leather is cut out of each pipe,
</p>

<p>
	[Page 79.]
</p>

<p>
	you would be able to hammer it down and get out the
	wrinkles and pipes. This is sometimes done by slovenly
	workers, but no good craftsman would resort to such
	inferior means, for, although it looks very well at first
	when finished and in wear, the result is far from
	satisfactory.
</p>

<p>
	We will now proceed with lasting the toe, which
	process can very well be left till the end, after the
</p>

<figure id="Figure088">
	<img src="Figures/088.png" />
	<figcaption>
		Fig. 88. --Shoemaker's Pincers.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	first three tacks, A B B, have been put in (Fig. 85), as
	described on page 76. The toe is the most important
	part to last, and if not well and properly done gives a
	very ungainly appearance to the boot or shoe, both
	before and after wear. There must necessarily be a lot
	of wrinkles around the toe, and when a tack is put in, a
	pipe forms between it and the tack next to it. To last
	a toe properly, full stuff must be got round the toe end
	as much as possible, and here it must be lasted away: <br />
	which means that, in putting in the draft tacks, stuff is
	drawn as much as possible to the toe. All fulness must
	be lasted away between these tacks, B B, dividing the
</p>

<p>
	[Page 80.]
</p>

<p>
	stuff equally between either side. These parts will need
	care to last them well; negligence here causes great
	defects, because an unsightly appearance of unevenness
	is caused if these wrinkles are not lasted out. If the
	toe is lasted well at the outset, it will keep up and look
	smooth till the boot is worn out.
</p>

<p>
	Next hammer the upper all round, A A and A (Fig.
	87). This will knock out all the wrinkles in this region
	that the "pipes" have caused, and will have to be done
	each time a tack is put in or altered on the top. Before
	putting in each tack, the leather must be pulled quite
	tight. This is done according to the substance of
</p>

<figure id="Figure089">
	<img src="Figures/089.png" />
	<figcaption>
		Fig. 89.--Side of Lasted Toe.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	the tops; the stouter they are the harder will be the
	work of lasting them.
</p>

<p>
	Fig. 88 shows a pair of shoemaker's pincers, A being
	the jaws in which to hold the leather. Lever the
	leather over, resting the fulcrum B on the inner sole,
	meanwhile pulling and pressing upon the handles C and
	C, holding them quite firmly, to give a proper grip of
	the leather. When this has been pulled enough, hold it
	in its place with the forefinger of the left hand until it
	has been made secure with a tack or rivet.
</p>

<p>
	Keep putting tacks in round the toe as far as the toe-cap
	extends until all the pipes and wrinkles are out, and
	the toe quite smooth as far as the dotted line A A. (See
	Fig. 89.) It is often harder to smooth a wrinkle than it is
	to get rid of a pipe, because if a tack is put through
	the centre of the pipe, at B B (Fig. 87), between two other
</p>

<p>
	[Page 81.]
</p>

<p>
	tacks or the wrinkles they have made, this tack will
	help to last the pipe out, and it can be got clear away with
	a tap or two of the hammer. These means are useless
	for a deep wrinkle, in which case the tack that has
	formed it must be taken out and an awl put under
	tacks to lift up the wrinkle C and form a pipe. Two
	must be put in at D and D, and then the pipe can be
	easily tapped out.
</p>

<p>
	When there is a toe-cap to the shoe, the vamp
	should be lasted first. While this is being done the
	toe-cap can be turned back as far as the line B B
	(Fig. 89). The vamp should be lasted as well as though
	it were not going to be covered with the cap. Before
	the cap is turned back into its place, to make an even
	surface to last the cap upon, the vamp may be lightly
	filed or rasped round in front of the tacks at C, C, C
	on the top, and at D, D round the edge, and then
	hammered again at both places.
</p>

<p>
	In hammering the upper, do not give heavy blows,
	but only tap it. This can be done well all round the
	boot, especially at the toe, where there is double
	substance, at the sides, where the side linings are, and at
	the heel, where there are the stiffeners. This hammering
	will all help to keep the boot in shape when made.
</p>

<p>
	When a top is very hard to last, and is difficult to
	get it close down to the last in front--which happens if
	the last is very hollow here, or the tops are heavy--the
	lasting may be done with the help of half of a pair of
	medium welts. A half is quite sufficient for one boot,
	and then the remaining half will do for the other boot.
	Make a hole in one end, get two large lasting tacks
	called sole tacks, cut two small circles of stout sole
	leather, and drive the tacks about half-way through, as
	at Fig. 86. Nail that end of the welt with the hole in
	it to one side of the boot with one of the tacks,
	knocking it into the round piece of leather. Hold the
	boot firmly with the left hand, and letting the piece of
	welt come right across the vamp, with the pincers pull
	the free end of welt on the other side, and get any
</p>

<p>
	[Page 82.]
</p>

<p>
	fulness away. Put a tack in the vamp, or put the other
	sole tack in through both the piece of welt and the vamp,
	until you have put a tack in each end of the piece of
	welt, then take out the sole tack and liberate the welt
	while again trying to get more purchase to pull, and
	the upper tighter to the last.
</p>

<p>
	This system is also very good for the waist when
	that is hard to get in. However, the mode of treatment
	is different, although on the same principle, for if in
	lasting the fore part it cannot be got tight enough with
	the pincers, a sideways knock can be given to the two
	sole tacks which will send their heads nearer together
	over the inner sole, and so tighten the welt. In the
	waist the welt does not go over the upper, but simply
	across the inner sole, from F to F (Fig. 85). Although
	tops need not be lasted much in the waist, it often
	happens that they are cut so small that some means
	like the above must be resorted to in this case to
	tighten the upper. Put a chisel or file under the welt,
	and gently lever it up while you knock the tacks side-ways,
	and at the same time drive them a little further
	in. As this tack has the piece of leather on it, this
	will prevent it from breaking away from the upper.
</p>

<p>
	The welts should have been bought of the proper
	substance, and being already divided into two long
	strips and quite wet, all that is necessary is to take off
	a fine shaving from the grain side. If wanted lighter,
	reduce them from the flesh side by means of a welt
	mill, going down a rack a tooth at a time on each side
	till of the required substance, or an ordinary knife may
	be used, see p. 52. The welt next needs to have an
	angular piece taken off the whole length from a corner
	on the grain side. This piece is about two-thirds of
	the way through and about 3/16 in. wide (as A in Fig. 85).
</p>

<p>
	This process will give the welt an end section like
	Fig. 53; this is shown grain side down, which is the
	position in which it is sewn in the boot. The arrow, A, B,
	indicates where the sewing-awl has to pass through. If
	welt, this piece is to be skived for about 2 in. at B (Fig. 53).
</p>

<p>
	[Page 83.]
</p>

<p>
	The way to take off the angular strip is by digging the
	point of the knife into the cutting-board, at an angle
	so that the welt can pass between the knife, the board,
	and the first and second joint of the forefinger of the
	right hand. The position of the knife, hand, and welt
	can be seen in the illustration (Fig. 53). Then, when the
	welt is pulled at B with the left hand, this angular piece
	will be cut clean off.
</p>

<p>
	The width proper for a welt is generally in accordance
	with the substance of the boot or shoe, but some
	quite light work is made with what might well be
	called an extra-full-wide welt. Gents.' widths that are
	generally recognised are half-wide welt, 1/4 in. full from
	upper; three-quarter-wide welt, 5/16 in.; wide welt, 3/8 in.
	full-wide welt, 7/16 in.; extra-full-wide welt, 1/2 in. In all
	cases the welt can be worked a little close on the inside,
	and full on the outside. A lady's can be 1/16 in. less than
	a gent.'s. For bevel work the welt should be thin before
	sewing in, and it is the sole that needs to be bevelled to
	fit the iron. To fit all leathers before using them for
	their varied purposes is most essential in all parts of
	boot making.
</p>

<p>
	To make a welt for dress shoes with a 1/8 in. edge the
	leather must be light, more particularly the sole and
	welt; the latter should not only be very light, but the
	fibres of the leather should be extremely fine in texture
	on both sides. The grain must be buffed off the welts,
	and then these are split down the centre and wetted.
	If they are too thick, reduce them on the fiesh side in
	a welt mill or skiving machine, and then fit in the
	ordinary way.
</p>

	SEWING AND STITCHING.

<p>
	Now the welts are fitted, the threads made, the boot
	lasted, and it is time to commence to sew. Before
	sewing, if the boot has dried, damp it all round over the
	holes, and well rub an old wet tooth-brush round the
	heel part, to moisten the edge of the stiffener.
</p>

<p>
	Sewing in the welt is one of the most important
</p>

<p>
	stages in boot and shoe making, as the ripping of a
	welt-seam nearly spoils the boot, since it cannot be well
	repaired without re-welting--a process far from pleasant
	if it has to be done before the sole is worn out. Before
	starting to sew, see that the thread is nicely twisted,
	waxed, and smooth throughout.
</p>

<p>
	Commence sewing in the welt at the left corner of
	the seat, proceeding towards the waist, the boot to be
	held between your knees, toe towards you. In the right
	boot this side, the inside of the waist, will be the longest.
	With the welt, measure from this point to the corner of
	the joint of the sole. Mark this point in order to know
	the length the welt is to be in the waist, and for
	this distance skive the welt from the grain side to
	about half the substance. Then the welt is ready for
	sewing in.
</p>

<p>
	[Page 85.]
</p>

<p>
	If a strap is used, it should have the buckle under
	the left foot; or if a stout piece of cord or rope is used,
	put the knot under the foot so that it is out of the way,
	and the thread does not catch in it and break while
	sewing. Place the boot, toe towards you, between the
	legs (which should be held close together), letting the
	strap go over the waist of the boot, as at A (Fig. 90), to
	keep it fixed while it is sewn. The tack at B can now
	be drawn, and the sewing-awl put in the first hole of the
	waist, as at C.
</p>

<p>
	Fig. 91 shows a larger section of the welt being sewn.
	It is used grain side downwards, with the surface from
	which the angular piece was taken off against the upper.
	While the awl is passed through a hole in the insole in

</figure>


<p>
	the position shown at C (Fig. 90), the welt shown (Fig. 91)
	is placed so that the awl may be passed through it at A,
	and is then withdrawn. The thread held in the left
	hand has one of its bristles put through the holes A
	(Fig. 91) and C (Fig. 90), which are now opposite. The
	thread is pulled through until the twisted centre is
	reached, and there is an equal length on each side,
	taking one end in each hand; and, with the awl in the
	right and the hand-leather, described on p. 61, in the
	left, you are ready to set the first welt stitch. As before,
	the awl is put through the next hole D (Fig. 90), about
	2 in. of the left bristle is passed through; the right
	bristle follows similarly, but from the opposite side.
	The points of the bristle change hands, and each is
	pulled through simultaneously for nearly half a yard.
	This is done (with their points directed away from the
	work) holding the bristles between the thumb and finger,
	with the palms of the hands upwards. When the thread
</p>

<p>
	[Page 86.]
</p>

<p>
	is pulled out a little, the hands are twisted so as to give
	the thread a turn round the hand, where it is held by
	the thumb and finger of both hands, and so the first
	pull is finished. The thread is then dropped, and
	picked up again near the holes, the bristles being kept
	between the thumb and finger, ready to use again.
	Another stroke is made, and this will probably pull
	the whole of the thread through. But if not, another
	pull must be taken. These pulls must be made in quick
	succession until the stitch is set at the final stroke,
	which is a tightening pull. It must be hard, especially
	on the side which pulls the stitch into the welt; but an
	over-strong pull on the other side may possibly pull the
</p>

	<figcaption>
		Fig. 92.--Awl and Bristle.
	</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
	stitch through the in-sole. To give this extra strong
	tightening pull, wind the left thread end round the
	hand-leather on the left hand, and the right thread end
	round the end, or knob, of the handle of the awl, as A
	(Fig. 92). When this stitch is done and pulled in tight,
	the next and all following stitches can be proceeded
	with in a similar way.
</p>

<p>
	After five or six stitches have been set, the seam can
	be knocked down with a hammer to make it smooth;
	but it must not be hit so hard as to bruise it. During
	this stoppage in the work it is well to wax at least one
	of the threads. It is best to wax only the end on the
	right side; then set another stitch and wax the other
	end, which this time is on the right. This is because the
	first time the thread passes through the leather a little
	wax is very apt to chip off and fly on to the work. In
	this way if the wax falls on the inner sole, it does no
	harm; otherwise, the wax would fall on the upper of
	the boot, and would need getting off, and would spoil
</p>

<p>
	[Page 87.]
</p>

<p>
	Russian or any coloured leather. The waxing is done by
	holding with the left hand one thread end straight above
	the work, holding a ball of wax in the thumb and finger
	of the right, and rubbing it up and down quickly and
	evenly. Proceed in the same way with the rest of the
	welt-sewing, until the other joint (e, Fig. 90) at the
	commencement of the waist is reached. Here skive off the
	remainder of the grain which has been left on the welt,
	turning it back upon the sole or upon a piece of thin
	wood, and skiving it as was done the other end. Then
</p>

<figure id="Figure093">
	<img src="Figures/093.png" />
	<figcaption>
		Fig. 93.--Welt Sewn in.
	</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
	sew it in till the point F is reached; there it is cut off,
	and the last welt stitch set over the end. When the toe
	is reached, the boot will need turning end for end, toe
	from you. It is best to draw each tack, so that the
	work shall not come unlasted. When the seat is sewn
	in before the welt, this can be sewn in with the same
	thread.
</p>

<p>
	The boot has now stitches in place of tacks, and all
	round there is surplus upper stuff, which must be cut off
	quite close to the stitch, but not so that it weakens the
	seam. The knife must be sharp, and the point dipped
	towards the inner sole, except at the heel seat, where it
	is held flat with the inner sole. The whole seam can
	be hammered down, to make it as smooth as possible.
	In sewing in the heel seat, well wax the two ends,
	and there must not be a join in the thread; this must be
</p>

<p>
	[Page 88.]
</p>

<p>
	long enough to go the whole way round, otherwise a
	new thread must be used. Commence sewing in the
	same way as before, but use no welt; therefore, on one
	side the stitch will lay on the inner sole, and on the
	other on the upper, as at A (Fig. 93). This sewing
	commences at B and ends at C. Make very solid stitches,
	pull the last end through to the inner sole, and tie
	the two ends into a good knot, to make a solid finish.
	The four tacks D, D, D, D must be taken out. A piece
	of chalk is rubbed round on the stitches, and a piece of
	felt is laid on the inner sole and tapped all round. This
	leaves a chalk mark to show the size that the felt will
	need to be. The inner sole is pasted all over, the piece
	of felt is laid upon it, hammered all over, and left to dry,
	and it is then trimmed all round level with the welt. A
	piece of good solid leather, of the size marked out by the
	dotted line E and F, is pegged in the waist with about
	four pegs. It should be skived thin at the ends and
	sides, leaving it thick in the centre only. This leather
	is pasted, and a thin piece of felt, by warming and
	splitting the felt, placed over it. If the bottom is hollow
	at G, the felt must be pasted, and another layer laid in
	the same way as the first; the sole is required to be
	made just level with the welt. The whole surface, from
	heel to toe, should be quite smooth, and when a
	sprinkling of powdered French chalk has been rubbed
	in the boot is ready to receive the sole.
</p>

<p>
	The sole leather has to be wetted, and dried until it
	is just mellow. Scrape off the grain, flesh the back, and
	then gently hammer it from the centre outwards. The
	dotted line in Fig. 94 shows the shape of the soles when
	bought in pairs, and also how the sole can be fitted to
	the boot so that, if it be a narrow toe, the piece G is not
	wasted. Two of these odd pieces will half heel a pair of
	boots, or, spliced together, will make one top-piece.
	Therefore, it is well to mark the sole round to the boot,
	and cut this piece off before putting the sole on. In
	this condition the sole leather is well pasted on the flesh
	side. The bottom of the boot must also have a coat of
</p>

<p>
	[Page 89.]
</p>

<p>
	paste, and French chalk should be sprinkled upon the
	felt to prevent the boot from creaking. A sole-tack is
	put through the centre at the toe end, as at A (Fig. 94),
	another at B, and two others at C and C. The sole is tapped
	all over with the hammer, and the boot held firmly on
	the knees by the strap which passes across the centre of
	the waist, a little below B, and under the left toe. The
</p>

	<figcaption>

	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	waist at either side should be treated
	with a waist- or cramp-hammer, which
	has a rounded face.
</p>

<p>
	In very strong work the waist of
	the sole is left to the full substance;
	but this depends greatly upon the kind
	of wear such boots are to be subjected
	to, and also the desire of those who will
	have to wear them. When left in this
	way, and stitched through close to the
	edge, it is called a square waist, and is
	suitable for riding and other strong
	boots. Usually the thickness of the
	sole is reduced off the flesh side at
	either side--not the whole way across.
	The sole is placed flat upon a board,
	grain side down, and a skiver taken off
	from D to D, and (by turning the sole
	the reverse way round) another from
	E to E, leaving the skivers a little
	thicker at F and F. When placed upon
	the boot, these dark-shaded pieces, F and F, will be
	next to the welt, not on top, as here shown.
</p>

<p>
	When thus prepared, and the work has been
	hammered to make the bottom quite smooth and level, it
	can be taken off the knees. A piece of blunt bone or
	hard wood run right round between the upper and the
	welt will make the welt level, and cause it to set flat
	against the sole. If well rounded up before the sole is
	put on, the boot will form a good guide to the shape
	that the sole should be, which has now to be rounded up.
</p>

<p>
	Rounding or knifing-up the sole is a part of the94.--Sole.
</p>

<p>
	[Page 90.]
</p>

<p>
	work needing care and attention, since it is this
	shaping-up which makes the difference between boots well
	finished and badly finished.
</p>

<p>
	The boot should be held firmly with the left hand
	upon its side on the knees. The knife must be very
	sharp, and held in the right hand. The point should
</p>

<figure id="Figure095-096">
	<img src="Figures/095-096.png" />
	<figcaption>
		Fig. 95.--Rounding up the Sole.

	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	lie on the first finger, the thumb on the top of the
	blade, and the rest with the handle held firmly in the
	hand. The point should overhang the side of the finger
	only just the substance of the sole, and not as shown at
	A in Fig. 95, which would cut the upper of the boot.
	The finger is kept against the sole, as shown at point B,
	and forms a guard to the knife. The piece (C) need not
	be taken off at one cut; so as not to go too far, it can be
	pared in very small pieces, and the shape of the boot
	obtained gradually.
</p>

<p>
	This paring is continued all round, but at C and D
</p>

<p>
	[Page 91.]
</p>

<p>
	the leather will be wanted to make the seat with
	and to cover the stitches; so the cut must not be close.
	As the upper does not overhang the sole so much
	towards the toe, more liberty may be given to the knife.
	The welt and sole should be pared closer at E than at F
	(Fig. 95); starting very close at G, it becomes gradually
	wider until reaching F, and similarly narrower until
	reaching B, and the ends of the waist C and D should
	match.
</p>

<p>
	Great care is necessary to make and keep the edge
	quite even and square. This is the only opportunity
	now left to give the fore part of the boot shape and
	form, and this should be done consistently with the
	shape the heel is to be. A channel is cut round the sole
	to contain the stitches with which it is sewn to the welt.
	It will be seen by the dotted line in Fig. 96 that this
	channel has to be cut very near the edge round the fore
	part, from B to C, and it is wider in the waist from A to
	B and C to D. This line can be marked with a pair of
	compasses, about 1/16 in. from the edge in the fore part
	and about 1/4 in. in the waist. Another way of marking
	the fore part is by filing off the sharp edge of the sole so
	that the edge of the bevel on the grain will form a line.
</p>

<p>
	The sole is channelled by holding the boot firmly with
	the left hand between the knees. The knife must be
	very sharp at the point, it should not be wide, and it is
	held in the right hand, as we hold a pen, only a little
	more upright. The third and little finger should be
	free. The tip of the second finger is placed on the face
	of the sole at the extreme edge. The knife is then dug
	into the leather at a (Fig. 96), and the third and little
	fingers are used against the edge of the sole and welt to
	steady the movement of the hand while the knife is
	being passed round the sole.
</p>

<p>
	We have already shown on page 90 how to hold the
	knife, and how its position should be at an angle of 50°
	with the flat of the welt. The point of the knife should
	pass through the grain of the leather and into the
	fibrous portions sufficiently to allow the thread to be
</p>

<p>
	[Page 92.]
</p>

<p>
	well embedded in it. This will be nearly half-way
	through the leather; but it is the substance of the sole
	that decides the thickness of thread which shall lie in
	this channel. The thread, lying in the firm part of the
	leather in this way, leaves the grain free to form a
</p>

<figure id="Figure097">
	<img src="Figures/097.png" />
	<figcaption>
		Fig. 97.--Channel laid open.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	covering for the stitch when the channel is laid
	down.
</p>

<p>
	Care must be taken with the waist, as the leather
	has been thinned down; and if the knife should go
	more than half-way through, it would not hold the
	stitch, and so the entire sole would be spoiled.
</p>

<p>
	The channel can be opened with any blunt instrument,
	but the prick-stitch (Fig. 79) is best. Put the
	point in at B (Fig. 97), and open the channel the whole
	way round, as shown at A, until C is reached. In doing
	this, do not disturb the edge, but throw the grain on top
	quite back so as to allow the stitching-awl to pass
	through without cutting. If cut, it would make the
</p>

<p>
	[Page 93.]
</p>

<p>
	channel harder to lay down, and cause an unsightly
	appearance in the finishing.
</p>

<p>
	The bone can now be rubbed round the welt, and
	it is ready for stitching with a thread made as directed
	on p. 60.
</p>

<p>
	In many boots and shoes the stitches on the welt
	side are shown up yellow. For this result, yellow flax
	is used to make the thread, and white wax or beeswax
	to wax it. If the ordinary shoemaker's brown wax
	is used, the flax must be waxed very sparingly indeed.
	Slate flax is very good for stitching, if the stitch is
	required to show black; but whatever material is used to

<p>
	form the thread it will need to be twisted lighter than
	sewing-thread, and should be a firm wiry thread.
</p>

<p>
	Before commencing to stitch the sole, run the fudge
	wheel round to make impressions upon the welt, then
	you will be able to set a nice, regular stitch by placing the
	awl carefully into each mark made by the fudge wheel.
</p>

<p>
	In making a boot you may sew and need not
	necessarily stitch the waist, or even the fore-part; but it
	is better to do so, since it makes the work much more
	solid. Should you sew the boot, either for quickness or
	because you find a difficulty in using the stitching awl,
	the seam will be much stronger if you use a small
	sewing awl the side of which has been rubbed off a
	little on the emery stick. Stitching is stronger than
	sewing because the stitches are got closer together than
	in sewing, and a much smaller hole is made owing to
	the shape of the awl and the way it is used.
</p>

<p>
	Before putting the awl through for the first time,
	place the strap over the waist of the boot and the left
</p>

<p>
	[Page 94.]
</p>

<p>
	knee. The boot should lie on the lap, the toe towards
	you, with the upper to the right and the sole to the left,
	the knees being held together quite firmly. With the
	thumb-nail of the left hand the channel can be opened
	for a length of about 2 in. This is to prevent the

<p>
	stitching awl (Fig. 98) from cutting or notching the thin
	piece of grain thrown up to form this channel, and
	which, if cut, would be very unsightly when laid down
	and finished. The stitching awl (Fig. 98) is a tool made like the
	sewing awl, which is illustrated in Fig. 67, p. 57. It is
	put into a handle similar, only a little smaller. The
	differences between the sewing and the stitching-awl are
	pointed out on p. 57, where the blade of the latter is
	shown without the handle. As shown at A (Fig. 98), the
	point has a drop or pitch, from B to C. As already
</p>

<p>
	[Page 95.]
</p>

<p>
	explained this awl must not be wriggled, as the sewing-awl
	is, but passed right through by one rapid and almost
	straight jerk, the boot being held firmly or the awl will
	break. There are also other kinds of awls used by shoe-makers,
	such as the heel-awl, the use of which is explained
	on p. 104, and the pegging-awl which is referred
	to on p. 110.
</p>

<p>
	Assuming the waist has been stitched or sewn, let
	us see how to stitch the fore-part from the point where
	you set the fudge on the welt. The left thumb is
	pressed against A (Fig. 99), just beyond where the awl is
	coming out, as shown by B. The curved part of the awl
	is laid on the upper, as seen at C (Fig. 99), with the point
	against the flat of the welt. It must then be pushed

	through by one sharp thrust, dropping the elbow while
	doing so, and sending the point through to the other
	side of A, and into the pit of the channel. Then the
	awl must be pulled out quickly, and in the same way,
	but this time raising the elbow.
</p>

<p>
	The way the stitch is set depends, to some extent,
	upon whether the work is to be "pricked up," "fudged,"
	left plain, which is called a "blind-welt," or the stitch
	sunk, and, the welt fudged to imitate stitching. For
	the first two it will have to be set up boldly by
	overcasting the stitch, letting the end of the thread in
	the right hand pass under the stitch during the whole
	time it is being set, as at a (Fig. 100), until it is finally
	pulled to the same tension as the other stitches. The
	three black lines at B show the mark of the fudge
	wheel, where the awl is to be put through each time.
	The part at C shows how the stitch is each time thrown
	the same way.

<p>
	can be reversed, and so much care need not be taken
	with the work. The stitch shown in Fig. 100 wants
	learning, and this is the best place to get the practice.
	To sink the stitch in order to fudge it, take the sewing
	awl, lay it on the upper as though you were going
	to sew, and, with the point against the welt, draw it

<p>
	round the welt from C to D (Fig. 99), letting it cut
	a channel in the welt the depth of the grain, and in the
	place where the stitches are to be set.
</p>

<p>
	The stitching can be proceeded with, opening about
	every inch or so of the channel with the left thumb-nail,
	at the same time putting a little wax on the thread on the
	left side. This process is continued the whole way
	round, pulling out the nail at E when you come to
	it. This nail is placed in the channel to avoid a mark or
	hole at F, where the tack is generally put, and a peg
	or piece of leather afterwards used to fill up.
</p>

<p>
	[Page 97.]
</p>

<p>
	The stitches that lie in the channel must be rubbed
	down the whole way round with a piece of bone, and a
	little paste is rubbed in, so that there is a thin uniform
	coat all round inside the channel. This is done by
	placing a piece of old soft rag over the right thumb, and
	putting the nail in the channel and rubbing it from one
	end to the other.
</p>

<p>
	The boot is held between the knees, heel towards the
	worker, and the channel is lightly laid down by passing
	the smoother side of an old file over it from A to B
	(Fig. 101), holding the file one end in each hand, and
	taking strokes from A to C, and D to E, and so on. Move
	the file in an outward direction, as indicated by the arrow,
	starting contact at F and finishing at G. This will throw
	over the edge as a burr the narrow margin of grain
	made in cutting the channel. This burr is thrown back
	again by the action of the back of the knife on the edge
	of the sole, used as the file on the top. Then the boot
	is turned round, and the knife is held in the right hand
	and the boot in the left, the blade of the knife being flat
	on the sole. In this position it is passed round to cut
	off this burr level with the face of the sole.
</p>

<p>
	The sole is then slightly damped all over and rubbed
	down with a long-stick made from a piece of round
	boxwood, about a foot long, smoothed by rubbing with fine
	sandpaper. The sole is worked down by well rubbing all
	round the seam, as at H, and then the centre. The long-stick
	must be passed over the leather briskly, but not so
	as to generate heat and thus injure the grain. For this
	process the boot has to be held firmly between the knees,
	the long-stick is used as the file was, one end in each
	hand. The stick must form a right angle with the
	channel, and the rubbing must be done with the centre
	of it, as at H. When this is done, and the bottom is
	smooth, the stitches on the welt can be lightly rubbed
	down with the bone, and the sole also hammered all
	over until it is perfectly even. A round-faced hammer
	is necessary for the waist, this part being nicely
	hammered.
</p>

<p>
	[Page 98.]
</p>

<p>
	So that the wax of the thread will not stick to the
	sewing awl, the point is thrust occasionally into a piece
	of soap. The awl is then passed under each stitch,
	which fastens together the sole and upper, as at I--not
	very far, but sufficiently to make the tight stitches
	lie in loops a little way from the upper, as at I, J.
</p>

<p>
	The end of the sole is filed about A, B (Fig. 101), to
	throw the grain up and make it smooth. The edge K
	is also made straight. The leather to make the seat-piece
	must be cut straight at one edge, and filed on one
	side. The two pieces are pasted, the edges put together,
	and a nail placed at A (Fig. 102), then about five pegs are

<p>
	driven in the sole-piece, and two in the sole; these pegs
	are indicated by the seven dots on Fig. 102. The piece is
	then pared to the shape required, as shown by the
	dotted line. Plenty of stuff is left all round to overhang
	the stitches 1/4 in. The angle must be taken off round,
	for a third or bare half of the thickness of the leather,
	to the inside dotted line on Fig. 102. The nail A is
	drawn, the tops of the pegs taken off, the grain of the
	leather cut away round them, and from the whole of the
	top, from B to C, but most away where the pegs are
	driven. These pegs should be 1/2 in. from the edge all
	around and when the cutting away has been done, the
	[unreadable] can be rasped to make it rough, though fairly
	[unreadable].

<h3>
	MAKING THE HEEL.
</h3>

<p>
	The split-lifts to form the heel are made from a piece
	of butt leather, generally first-cut, as it requires to be
	tight, and must be supple. The piece should be about
</p>

<figure id="Figure103">
	<img src="Figures/103.png" />
	<figcaption>
		Fig. 103:--Cutting Split-lifts.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	7 in. long and 1 in. wide; this, split down the
	centre while quite wet, makes a pair.
</p>

<p>
	The splitting is done as follows:--Place
	the leather (Fig. 103), grain side up, on a board
	held upon the knees, let the left-hand thumb
	rest at A, and the little finger at B. With the
	first, second, and third fingers press upon the
	leather to keep the part marked C firm on
	the board. The knife, held in a slanting
	position, is put in at D, on top, and passed
	through to E on the other side. The knife
	is drawn along the dotted line D until it
	reaches F, with the point on the lower side,
	and following the dotted line C to A. This
	splitting gives two wedge-shaped strips of
	leather, A, B, as shown (Fig. 104). If not
	made quite to this shape while splitting, trim
	them up afterwards. One strip is then laid
	on the lap-iron, with the thin edge towards
	the worker. The left thumb is placed upon
	A (Fig. 104), and the right upon B, with thumb-nails
	towards you, the hands back to back, and the two
	forefingers against C and D. In this way the thumbs can be
	pressed very hard, and the two ends of the strip brought
	round to the dotted shape E and F. The thin edge will
	pucker up in the centre (G and H), but the puckers are
	hammered flat by tapping round the centre while holding
	the two ends between the thumb and finger of the
	left hand. Thus one split-lift is made, and the process
</p>

<p>
	[Page 100.]
</p>

<p>
	must be repeated for the other. The leather to make
	split-lifts must be split while wet, but it is best to let
	the strips dry a little before blocking them on the
	lap-iron. In drying they open a little at the ends, as shown
</p>

<p>
	by the dotted lines. For this reason the ends are
	brought together when making, in order that they may
	dry the proper shape.
</p>

<p>
	The heel, as shown in Fig. 102, is rasped off and made
</p>

<p>
	rough so as to receive a thin coat of paste the same
	width as the split-lift, which is rasped on one side and
	treated similarly; it is then put on as shown in Fig. 105,
	the boot being held firmly, the heel end on the right and
	the toe on the left knee, by the strap passing over the
	waist and between the knees.
</p>

<p>
	The split-lift is placed with its edge flush with the
	edge of the centre of the seat-piece at A. A peg is
	driven in, another at B, one at C, then one at D, and
</p>

<p>
	[Page 101.]
</p>

<p>
	another at E. These pegs will keep the split-lift in its
	place while other pegs are being put in between them;
	all must be placed towards the centre, as far away from
	the edge as the thickness of the split-lift will admit.
</p>

<p>
	This is then nicely pared round. If a gent's or lady's
	square-heel boot, the outside corner should be left
	square; towards the back and inside corner it can slant
	in somewhat. The tops of the pegs may be cut off, the
	top rasped as was the seat, and the two ends trimmed.
	A piece of zinc slipped under the end previous to

<p>
	cutting protects the grain of the sole from being scored
	in the process.
</p>

<p>
	The split-lift being now pegged in its proper place on
	the seat, the top of it is roughed with a rasp and pasted.
	The first entire lift, after roughing and pasting the
	flesh side, is thea put on grain side upwards. The
	size for each lift piece should be got by placing a piece
	of paper over the split-lift. Then stroke the paper over
	the edge of the split-lift, until the edge of the heel
	is shown. This pattern will do for roughing out all the
	lifts for a square heel, and they should be a little larger
	than the pattern. If a smart (hollowed) heel is to be
	made, each successive lift may be a little smaller than
	the one on which it lies. For the present boot only two
	whole lifts are wanted to make the heel, shown in
	Fig. 106, A being the sole and seat-pieces, B the split-lift,
	and C and D the first and second whole lifts. In putting
	on the first lift, about five pegs can be inserted midway
</p>

<p>
	[Page 102.]
</p>

<p>
	between the centre and edge, as was done in the split-lift,
	the top of the pegs being cut off with a portion of
	the lift. The top is rasped until nearly all the grain
	is off the leather, then it is trimmed to the shape of
	the heel. The second lift is then roughed, the two
	surfaces pasted, and the lift placed and kept where it
	belongs on the heel by driving in two 3/4 rivets at E and
	F; or two sole tacks may be used temporarily, and then
	withdrawn w^hen the sewing down has been done. At
	the breast of the heel the first lift should overhang the
	ends of the split-lifts a little, and the second should
</p>

<figure id="Figure107">
	<img src="Figures/107.png" />
	<figcaption>
		Fig. 107.--Flat Waisted Last.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	overhang the first, and so on, until the heel is the height
	required, and the top piece is on. A channel, shown by
	the dotted line, must be cut in this top lift. If a second
	cut be made an eighth of an inch from the first, with
	the knife held slanting the reverse way, it will cut a
	V-piece out and form a groove, which need not be deep,
	for the stitch to lie in. The sole and seat-piece should
	be rubbed round from G to H with the bone to open it a
	little, so that the seat stitches may be clear.
</p>

<p>
	If the last is out of range for the height of heel you
	wish to make, it can be counteracted by feathering the
	insole, and sewing close and full, unless the last is very
	badly out, when its construction must be altered. All the
	full lines circumscribing the lasts in Figs. 107, 108, and
	109 are alike; and it will be seen by Fig. 107 that the
	last is somewhat dead, or flat in the waist. By building
	a high heel, one lift above the other, without reducing

	[Page 103.]

<p>
	them at the breast, the heel will be thrown out of range,
	as shown at A, B, and C (Fig. 107). If to give a better
	range the lifts are reduced at the breast when the boot is
	worn, the pressure of the foot on D will press it down to

	and right across the last from C to D; skive the leather,
	as shown by the dotted line B, tapering to nothing at C

<p>
	pitches of the same heel on the difterent-shaped lasts.
</p>

<p>
	To sew down the heel the boot is placed on the
	knees with the heel towards you, and the lifts to the
	left, as shown in Fig. 111, and held very firmly by the
	strap. The thread for the heel should be about four or
	six strands stouter than sewing thread. The heel awl is
	a tool nearly straight, but in other respects like the
	sewing-awl. It is used in a large sized sewing-awl
	handle, and before making each hole the blade needs to
</p>

<p>
	[Page 105.]
</p>

<p>
	be dipped into soap. It has a thick substance to go
	through, so the leather must be sufficiently moist, and
	good bristles are wanted on the thread.
</p>

<p>
	To make the first hole for sewing the heel, the awl is
	put in at A (Fig. 111) and brought out at B. The exact
	place where the point of the awl is to be put in the sole
	is shown in Fig. 112, which is a section of the welt and
	seat. The heel is indicated by the dotted lines B B, and
	the first hole is made at near A the corner of the heel,
	and the thread is drawn half-way through. In the same
	way the second hole is made at C. In making all the
	holes after the first, the awl must be kept clear of
	the seat stitch (Fig. 112), as this might impoverish the
	stitch and make it somewhat rotten. After the second
	hole is made, the point of the awl is placed under the
	seat stitch to raise it in line with the mouth of the hole,
	so that the sewing thread may pass through the loop of
	the seat stitch. The stitch is made by passing through
	the two bristles from opposite ends of the hole one after
	the other. The two ends are then drawn through together,
	pulling the thread hard on both ends. The third
	hole is made in the same way by putting the awl in at D,
	and the sewing process is repeated. This will make
	a stitch as seen at H, coming out of loop G, and returning
	into loop I; and when the stitch is drawn tight
	it draws the upper to the sole, and also holds the
	heel on. This process is repeated, each hole following on
	as at E and F, until all the stitches that lie on the
	upper leather are sewn down. The stitches in Figs.
	111 and 112 are shown loose to clearly illustrate their
	positions. The heel thread should fall into the groove
	cut on the top of the heel, the last stitch being finished
	off with a knot. After each few stitches are set the heel
	should be hammered down to keep it in its place. When
	the heel is sewn all round, and the ends of the thread
	cut off, it can be firmly and well hammered down all
	over.
</p>

<p>
	Now when the leather is damp and workable is the
	time to make the seat; and after it has been hammered
</p>

<p>
	[Page 106.]
</p>

<p>
	on top, the stitches ad (Fig. 111) should be rubbed down
	well with the bone. The heel can then be dressed carefully
	with the pene end of the hammer, so that in the
	process all the stitches are covered by the leather. In
	commencing, the pene of the hammer must strike the
	heel at the bottom of the split-lift and the top of the
	sole and sole-piece, as shown in Fig. 113. This is to drive
	the leather over the stitches as much as possible. When
	this pening has been done all round the heel, turn the
	boot and commence at the extreme edge B, holding the
	boot in the position shown; and when hammering
</p>

<figure id="Figure113-114">

	<figcaption>
		Fig. 113--Pening to cover the Stitch.
		Fig. 114.--Trimming the Seat.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	towards the back, let the toe slip between the knees.
	The blows of the hammer do not want to be hard, but
	sharp and frequent, and repeated in various rows all
	round the edge of the heel, as at A (Fig. 114), leaving no
	part untouched. Then the leather can be slightly
	flattened with the face of the hammer.
</p>

<p>
	The next step is to trim the rough edges of the seat
	at B. Hold the boot firmly upon the knees (as at
	Fig. 114), and just start cutting with the point of the
	knife; and to save it from slipping into the upper,
	a metal guard will be found very useful. The handle
	of an old metal spoon hammered thin and flat (as A,
	Fig. 115) makes a handy guard to the knife for several
	purposes. This guard is placed on the upper, as at C,
	and moved along with the knife when cutting off the
</p>

<p>
	[Page 107.]
</p>

<p>
	rough edge D. The seat is trimmed up, so that E is left
	firm and solid, and well covering the stitch. The next
	process is running the seat-breaker (Fig. 116) round from
	the other corner of the seat. In the illustration A is the
	cutter, B the guard, C the handle. The guard B is put
	against the top of the seat at the opposite corner to B
	(Fig. 114), and, taking three or four sweeping strokes in
	one direction only, the seat should be made smooth and
	even all round. If it is not, the lumps must be cut off
	with the knife, and the breaker used again. This finishes
	the edge E; and the edge B must now be rubbed round
	with the welt file (Fig. 117), used for smoothing the welt,
</p>

<figure id="Figure115-116">

</figure>

<p>
	etc., made with cross-cuts on one side only (as illustrated).
	The heel can be allowed to dry, and it can then have the
	remainder of the lifts put on.
</p>

<p>
	If a pegged seat is wanted, it must be arranged for
	before the boot is lasted, as it is necessary to skive the
	stiffener (Fig. 74) much thinner and more tapered than is
	wanted for a sewn seat. The inner sole is not fitted and
	holed as described on p. 72 (Fig. 78), but it is left quite
	square and plain to the edge, to where the heel is coming;
	the waist and fore-part only are holed. The seat portion
	is left its full substance, and it will be found that
	even then the centre is higher than the sides, unless the
	bottom of the last is very flat at the heel--which it
	should not be, as this will make the boot feel very
	uncomfortable to the heel in wear.
</p>

<p>
	A pair of thin split-lifts about 1/2 in. wide must be
</p>

<p>
	[Page 108.]
</p>

<p>
	made, as described on p. 100, to go round the edge of the
	inner sole. The thickness that these split-lifts should
	be must be decided by the amount of drop that the last
	has at the edge, as their purpose is to make the top as
	near flat and level as possible. The split-lift can be
	pegged on with a few short fine pegs, so that in pegging
	the seat the sole and all the upper leather and stiffener
	should lie quite flat. Pegs should go through everything,
	inner included; otherwise they are never solid, and tend
	to yield to any strain from top and bottom; so pegs
	must go straight through each substance, and not on the
	slant. Fig. 118 is a section of the seat, upper, stiffener,
</p>

<figure id="Figure117-118">

</figure>

<p>
	inner sole, split-lift, and sole, with the right side with the
	split-lift, and the left without. The difference between a
	peg that is driven through straight, as the line A, and
	the one driven aslant, as the line C, can be easily seen.
	To get upon the leather on the left the same effect as
	shown by the line A, the peg would have to be driven as
	the line C, which is not nearly so strong as A.
</p>

<p>
	When the inner sole is prepared, the top can be lasted
	round the seat as described on pp. 75-77, excepting
	that the lower edge of the upper leather must reach
	towards the centre fully F in. more than is needed for a
	sewn seat. Bought tops are generally quite large enough
	to allow this, without making the golosh too low at the
	back; but tops not large enough must be sewn. There
	are several ways of sewing the upper to the inner sole;
	but this is not done as described for a sewn seat. The
	upper leather can be stitched by felling to the inner

<p>
	[Page 109.]
</p>

<p>
	sole, or the stitch can be set, first on the sole side and
	then on the upper; but that is nor solid enough for
	good work, as too much depends upon the pegs.
</p>

<p>
	The best method is as follows:--Hold the boot as
	for stitching the sewn heel, with the heel towards you
	(see Fig. 119). The sewing awl is put in at A, the point
	is brought out at B, and a thread is put through and
	halved. The awl is next put in at C and brought out
	at D; this is a little on the slant, and the remainder of
	the holes can follow the alternate dots from side to side

	in like manner. The stitch is set like this: the thread
	end hanging from B is held in the left hand, and when the
	hole C D is made the end at A is put into C; B is then
	put between A C under the thread that is going to form
	the stitch across these two holes. The thread A is then
	drawn out with the left hand at D, and the thread B
	drawn through under the stitch a C. This will draw
	the upper over at B. The next stitch is set in the same
	manner, which will draw D over, and so on right round.
	Each time a stitch is set it can be hammered down on
	top and at the side; this drives the stiffener into its
	place, and helps to make a nice square edge, shown
	by the line E F, to form the seat upon. By the diagram
	(Fig. 119) it can be seen at the last stitch that the two
	ends G and H tied together will make a good finish,
</p>

	with a solid and smooth seam, and that the top is flat
	to receive the sole.
</p>

<p>
	The sole and sole-piece are put on as with a sewn boot,
	only they are pared nearer to the upper, leaving about
	1/16 in. all round. A row of fine pegs, just long enough
	to go through the inner sole, is put in (as shown by A,
	Fig. 120) near to the edge of the sole and sole-piece;
	and they must reach the edge of the inner sole and just
	go through it. A straight fine awl is like an ordinary
	fine bradawl, it should be used with a short stumpy
	handle; and if the leather be too hard for it to be forced

<p>
	in by hand pressure, it can be held in its place with the
	left, and driven in with a hammer in the right. The
	tops of the pegs must be cut off, rasped, and pasted,
	ready to receive the split-lifts, as described on p. 101.
	When the split-lift is put on, it must have a row of
	pegs put round, as in Fig. 120, only they must not be
	quite so near the edge, as shown by B. The first lift
	is treated in the way described on p. 101, and, with
	these exceptions, all is the same, as with a sewn seat.
</p>

<p>
	A steel spring inserted in each waist is useful for
	those who like a boot or shoe to fit close under the waist
	and instep, or for those who have a flat foot and want
	to improve it. This spring need not be so strong as to
	hurt the foot; and at first wearing it is best to have
	springs very little curved, and stiff enough to keep the
	waist from dropping by the weight of the body. As
	you get used to them, a spring more flexible, yet
</p>

<p>
	[Page 111.]
</p>

<p>
	stronger, can be used. There are several kinds of
	springs--single, double, twins, Goodyear's, etc.; but a
	good strong single spring will answer the best, using
	women's or men's as wanted. Flexura springs can be
	got at almost any grindery shop. The price is about
	3d. or 4d. per pair, or from 2s. 2d. to 4s. per dozen. Two
	pieces of brass or zinc for the plates, and about eight

<p>
	copper tacks, should be included with each
	pair. Fig. 121 shows their shape; they
	are about 4-1/2 in. long, and 1/2 in. to 3/4 in.
	wide; this is before they go in the boot.
	They will not need padding, as the spring
	should not be strong enough to hurt the
	foot. Should this happen, it can be
	prevented by bending the spring back very
	gently at first, and increasing as you
	proceed, so as to make the spring nearly
	straight and yet not to break it.
</p>

<p>
	To put the springs in, the boot is
	unlasted after the inner sole is fitted, and
	put on the lap-iron to have riveted upon it
	a plate of brass or zinc. This plate of
	metal has three holes made in it; it is laid
	upon the flesh side of the inner sole, as at
	A (Fig. 122), and three holes are pierced
	with a fine awl in the inner sole. The
	place for the end of the spring is just
	below the end of the waist, as shown. If it is put
	nearer the ball of the foot, the steel will work through
	the metal plate and the leather also, and thus let
	water in before the other parts of the boot are half
	worn out.
</p>

<p>
	Then lay the sole on a board, and from the grain side
	drive three copper tacks through, so that the heads are
	well into the grain and smooth with the leather. Take
	the shoe off the board and put it with the tack heads
	flat on the lap-iron. Put the plate of metal over the
	points of the tacks, and hammer it down to the leather.
	Cut the points off near to the plate, and, while the heads
</p>

<p>
	[Page 112.]
</p>

<p>
	are flat on the iron, gently burr or rivet the ends to fix
	the plate very solid.
</p>

<p>
	Proceed, as previously described, with making until
	the welt is in and the seat and waist sewn down; then
	the steel spring is put in. It has a hole through one
	end only, C (Fig. 122). The other end, A, is put under the
	metal plate, as shown by the dotted lines in Fig. 122, a
	tack is put through the hole c in the spring, and when
	the boot is made it can be cut off and riveted in the
	same way that was done for the plate. This is usually

<p>
	enough to hold the spring, but a few stitches can be put
	across from side to side if it needs it.
</p>

<p>
	The boot is then proceeded with as before described;
	but no welt is wanted in the waist if it is to be made
	pegged, which, if done properly, is by far the best for a
	flexura spring waist.
</p>

<p>
	In fitting the inner sole for a pegged waist the waist
	is skived at the edges only, and not very far in, excepting
	at the centre of the inside waist (as D) where the outer
	sole will have a greater curve, and still allow the pegs
	to be put in, so that they will go through the whole
	substance of the leather. For the pegged seat more
	upper leather is wanted to last over than for sewn work,
	and this can be sewn down as described for the seat.
</p>

<p>
	For a pegged waist the sole need not be made
	thinner in the waist than for a sewn one, unless it
	is very stout; and in that case, it can be thinned
</p>

<p>
	[Page 113.]
</p>

<p>
	uniformly from the grain side; so that, although the
	waist is thinner than the sole, it is all the same substance.
	Assuming that the sole is stitched on and the seat pegged,
	we have only to peg the waist. This is very important
	work, for if the waists once give way they are exceedingly
	difficult to repair.
</p>

<p>
	A diagram of the waist is given in Fig. 123 on a larger
	scale to show the essential points. The dotted lines
	A and A show the inner sole. The full lines B and B
	show where the outer sole is to be rounded up. The
	lines C and C show the edge of the upper leather, and
	D D show the stitches that hold it in its place, which are
	like those in the seat. If the flexura spring should
	require further fastening, the stitches D, D can be drawn
	from one side to the other. E E show where three

	<figcaption>
		Fig. 124.--Split Strip for light Pegged Work.

</figure>

<p>
	rows of pegs should be put in. About six holes, marked
	F, F, F, F, F, F, should be made in each side, and as each
	hole is made a peg should be put in. This holds the
	waist in its place. Then between each two of these
	another peg can be put in, as at G. The remaining
	holes necessary to complete one row are made, as shown
	at H I; each one is pegged as it is made. When one
	row of pegs are in, trim off the tops with the knife or
	rasp before putting in the second row, and proceed the
	same with the second row if you intend to put a third,
	which will be necessary for heavy work.
</p>

<p>
	For making light pegged work there need not be a
	middle sole, as a simple runner will suffice. Measure
	from joint to joint on the fore-part; select a piece of
	firm leather, first-cut is best, and cut it to this length, and
	about 1-1/2 in. wide. Split this strip down the centre as
	in making a split-lift; the cut, being 1/2 in. wide (as shown
	in Fig. 124), will give on each side 1/2 in. width of solid
	stuff to peg through. Skive the strip a little wider and
	thinner at the toe, so that you may get it round
</p>

<p>
	[Page 114.]
</p>

<p>
	smoother. Hammer it, peg it on, cut the pegs off, skive
	it down towards the centre, and fill the bottom up in
	the ordinary way. By this means it may be made as
	flat or round as you choose. No matter how broad the
	bottoms are intended to be, the pegs must be far enough
	from the edge to go through quite 1/8 in. from the edge
	of the insole. It will be found best to slant the edge
	with an ordinary knife, but be very careful not to cut
	the upper. Hold in the left hand the piece being cut
	away, twist it between the thumb and finger, and only
	use the extreme point of the knife, guided by the second
	finger of the right hand. The fore-part iron will do for
	smoothing with as for sewn boots.

<p>
	whole lift, A (Fig. 125). To make a 1-1/4 in. heel will need
	two more lifts and the top piece. The top of a should
	be roughed with the rasp, and pasted, and the third lift
	laid on and secured by two rivets nearly in the centre;
	this is also rasped and pasted, and the last or top lift put
	on. This lift is rasped and pasted, and also the flesh
	side of the top piece, which is held firm by headless
	rivets put in at A and B (Fig. 126) so that it may be
	rounded up. The heel can be rounded up to whatever
	shape may be desired. Fig. 126 is a medium heel; it
	can be built smarter, or quite square, as the dotted lines
	show in A and B; either way, it should be longer and
	more square on the outside corner C (Fig. 126), which in
	this case shows the right heel. The remainder of the
	rivets can be put in not very near the edge, as D and E
	(Fig. 126). They should slant outward all round, as B
	(Fig. 125).
</p>

<p>
	[Page 115.]
</p>

<p>
	To blind on the top piece drive six blinders, or
	headless rivets, down the side of those at A, D, and F
	(Fig. 126), as shown there by the small dots. Prior to
	pasting the top lift these blinders are put in, leaving
	enough to go through about two-thirds or three-quarters
	of the substance of the top piece. The top piece is
	laid on and hammered down, causing these portions of
	rivets to embed themselves into it, and so hold it on.
	For very light work, or when the wearer objects to his
	heels making a noise in walking, blinders can be put in
	all round, and other nails need not be used; but then
	the top piece wears out quicker than if it has nails or

<p>
	brads in it. The system has one advantage--that heels
	need not be worn down badly, as it is not much trouble
	to slip this piece off, knock another on, and pare it up
	and finish. It need be renewed only as far as it is
	worn; therefore it is as well to put this top piece on in
	two pieces, joined as shown by the dotted line (Fig. 127),
	when only the part C need be slipped off and replaced.
</p>

<p>
	The position for the brads is as shown at C (Fig. 127),
	being on the outside of the heel, unless the wearer
	treads inside, when the heels should be bradded on the
	inside. The top piece should be left about 1/16 in. wider
	where the brads are to go, leaving something to trim off.
	By this means the brads are got quite to the edge of
	the top piece, where the hardest wear comes. One, two,
	or three rows of brads or rivets can be put in, according
	to the strength of the boot; a third row need only reach
	from D to D, the inner row being the shortest.
</p>

<p>
	Most of the care necessary to give symmetry to the
	bottom of the boot lies in fitting the inner sole and
</p>

<p>
	[Page 116.]
</p>

<p>
	sewing in the welt and seat; and to have a boot well
	ranged, this must be kept in mind. The inner sole
	must be so arranged that when the heel is built to its
	full height, and the top piece on, a straight-edge placed

<p>
	as shown by the line D (Figs. 125 and 128) will show that
	the flat of the top piece is level with the flat part of the
	sole.

<p>
	through sewing the welt and seat corners too snug, as the
	dotted lines E E show in Fig. 122. Piaising the point
	of the sewing-awl here and dropping it at F will make a
	heel built lift upon lift too high in front, as at B (Fig. 129);
	to make it stand flat upon the ground a wedge-lift would
	be put in, as at C. The reason for this is that the
	last is round at the bottom of the heel, it being highest
	at C (Fig. 122) and lowest at F and E E. The closer
	the two dotted lines E E, the higher they are, as at
	A (Fig. 129), and the more they are sewn down at F
	(Fig. 122), the lower they are at D (Fig. 129), and this
	gives the result explained. If the reverse is done it will
</p>

<p>
	[Page 117.]
</p>

<p>
	make a heel too high at the back, as shown by A
	(Fig. 130); but this fault is not nearly such a bad
	one as the other, except in a spring waist; then
	the spring would raise the waist and pitch the back of
	the heel so prominently as to make it very uncomfortable
	in wear.
</p>

<p>
	From Fig. 131 can be seen the importance of having
	this line a curve sweeping towards the heel, and straight
	at the sole. The way certain lasts have to be fitted
	for particular types of feet sometimes makes it difficult
	to do the fore-part in nicely; but it should range
</p>

<figure id="Figure131">
	<img src="Figures/131.png" />
	<figcaption>
		Fig. 131.--Correct Range for Spring Waist on Last.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	correctly at least from the waist to the heel, as from
	A. to B.
</p>

<p>
	A heel dropping, as at B (Fig. 130), which makes it
	look higher in breast than at the back, or rising at
	A (Fig. 129), which makes it look higher at the back than
	at the breast, is very unsightly, and throws the boot
	or shoe out of position in wear. It is this sort of heel
	which gets worn down at the front, B E (Fig. 128),
	and also causes the waist to drop, as though the wearer
	had a flat foot. The effect is that the upper part is
	drawn out of place, and wrinkles are made on the instep
	of the boot, making it appear old with only a very
	little wear.
</p>

<p>
	The range of the heel has a certain effect upon the
	pitch, because a little defect in the range can to a
	certain extent be set right by properly pitching a heel;
	but it is not advisable here to dwell upon makeshifts to
	overcome defects, as the aim is to show how to be
	boot-makers, not boot-doctors. Therefore, remember that
</p>

<p>
	[Page 118.]
</p>

<p>
	range depends upon pitch, and pitch upon the form of heel.
</p>

<p>
	A gent's ordinary military heel (Fig. 131) should be
	pitched as C, unless the boot has a spring waist; then
	itcan be pitched as shown by the dotted lines D and E.
	When off the last, and also when on the foot, the waist

<p>
	will have a tendency to rise, and so pitch the heel
	forward, as shown by A (Fig. 132). The spring waist will
	also have the effect of making the toe lie flat on the
	ground, as at B, which adds beauty to the boot or shoe.
	The higher the heel, the more forward it wants to

	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	be pitched, as a (Fig. 133); or, for a lady's, as shown at A
	(Fig. 134). An extra smart high heel could come even as
	far as the dotted line B. The last should then have
	more drop in the waist, and more off the bottom of
	the back of the heel, as at the dotted line C.
</p>

<p>
	The shape for a heel is to a great extent a matter of
	fancy, though some heels would look out of place on
	certain work. A boot for heavy wear should have a
</p>

<p>
	[Page 119.]
</p>

<p>
	square-shaped heel. A light dress-boot can have a small
	top piece. For ladies, even if the heel is smart, it is
	best to have the top piece somewhat large. Low heels
	are best for walking, riding, shooting, or for any purpose
	where the wearer is likely to be long on the feet. For
	light walking-dress wear there is no objection to high
	heels providing the wearer knows how to walk on them,
	which very few persons do.

	KNIFING-UP AND FINISHING.
</h3>

<p>
	Now "all the stuff, is on"; and the next process
	isknifing-up, which is the paring off of all surplus stuff
	that may be on the edge, waist, or heel, and the whole
	process that gives the finishing touches to the shape
	of the boot. It is by skilful knifing that the desired
	shape is got to the heels, as the concave shape seen in a
	very hollow or smart heel could not be got by rasping.
</p>

<figure id="Figure135">

	<figcaption>
		Fig. 135.--Heel in the Rough.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	The heel with all the stuff on is very rough round the
	edge, as at A (Fig. 135). Before taking this off, round up
	the top piece to the required shape, as explained on
	page 89, for the soles. The boot is now held very firmly
	on the right arm, holding the heel in the hand, but
	leaving the side B free to work upon. In the knifing-up
	commence from A, in Fig. 136, not touching the top piece
	nor the seat b. The position of the hand and knife
	are shown at C and D, and the action of paring is to
	drop the hand and raise the knife. The more hollow
	the heel is to be, the deeper is the knife dug in, the more
	the hand is dropped and the knife raised in the second
	half of the cut. This process is continued all round
	roughly, and then gone over a second and third time,
	each time taking off the bumps left between the former

	Holding the shoe on top of the knees, with the edge

</p>

<p>
	up, as Fig. 137, the edge of the sole is now knifed-up with
	the knife in the right hand, the point only between the
	thumb and finger, as shown by B (Fig. 95, page 90),
	commencing at A (Fig. 137), and going round to the joint
	on the other side. Only little shavings are taken off, for
	the sole has been already shaped; all that now remains
	is to make the edge quite square.
</p>

<p>
	To prepare for knifing-up the waist, the corners A
	and B (Fig. 138) must be well knocked down by means
	of a corner-beater or welt-beater, which is made by
	heating an old file, turning it back for about a third of
	the way, and while hot beating it up square, at A and B
</p>

	(Fig. 139), on the lap-iron, with a hammer. Another form
	for a corner-beater is shown at Fig. 140. When it is
	the shape required, heat it again, and put it into cold
	water, and when dry, brighten it a little with emery
	cloth and temper it by reheating till the brightened
	part turns blue.
</p>

<p>
	The corners are knocked down by putting a corner-
	beater (Fig. 140), right into the corner of the heel and
	waist, at A or B, and hammering it well down until a
	decided corner is made to the heel. While this is being
	done, the boot is held in the position shown by Fig. 138,
	by the stirrup, firm upon the knees. Then hammer each
	side of the waist with the peen end of the waist or
	cramp hammer; this will knock the edge of the waist
	over, to cover the stitch, and also make it lie closer to
	the upper. This process will leave marks at C; but a
	second row of taps, made with the peen of the hammer
	held so that these lines shall cross the others, will make
	the edge more even, and also very firm at the side of the
	stitches. The waist can now be hammered along each

<p>
	side with the face of the hammer, and with the knife,
	held in the hand as shown in Fig. 136, nicely trim each
	side to make it round and even.
</p>

<p>
	To peen the heel, hold the boot as Fig. 141, and
	hammer the heel all round at A, as shown by the short
	strokes. In this process, as in the knifing-up, there is no
	need to touch the seat or the top piece. This peening is
	continued till every part of the heel that was touched
	with the knife has been hammered, and then an extra
	touch up with the face of the hammer will make the
	heel ready to be rasped.

<p>
	an iron frame, is used before and after the heel is peened,
	and will be found to save a lot of labour; the handle, A,
	is placed in the left hand, and B in the right; C is the
	blade, or cutting iron; D D are screws by which the cut
	of the iron is adjusted. The boot is held firmly between
	the knees, and the tool acts as a woodworker's spokeshave.
	Held in the fingers with the two thumbs pressed
	upon the heel, it will be found that a very even stroke
	can be made by opening and closing the hand.
</p>

<p>
	The edge of the sole can now be peened; this wants
	to be done very carefully, as all the tools that follow
	depend upon this having been done in a proper way.
	The centre of the sole's edge is made hollow, as shown
	at Fig. 144, therefore the peen of the hammer must not
	touch either the welt edge a or the sole edge B. The
</p>

<p>
	[Page 124.]
</p>

<p>
	sole edge must be struck only on the centre, where the
	sole and welt meet at C and D. Here is shown how the
	edge should be hit, and this should be continued all
	round.
</p>

<p>
	A shoemaker's rasp used for smoothing has one side
	cut as a file; but the rasp side is now used, and this has
	one end flat, and the other round. For the edge of the
	sole use the round side, and use the flat for the heel,
	unless it has to be hollowed, then the round is used.
	In rasping with the flat part upon the heel, the boot is
	held, as in Fig. 142, upon the knees, and the fingers A
	are kept as a guard over the edge of the seat that this
</p>

<figure id="Figure143">
	<img src="Figures/143.png" />
	<figcaption>

	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	part may not be touched, while the rasp B is rubbed
	lengthways, in a direction from C to D; and while
	making each stroke, throw the rasp to the right, to give
	it a diagonal motion from A to E, and continue this all
	round, except on the seat and top-piece, until the heel
	is quite smooth. The fingers must be passed round to
	feel that it is even, and then the file side of the rasp can
	be used in a similar fashion.
</p>

<p>
	The edge of the sole must then be rasped. The position
	of the rasp is sliown at a in Fig. 145. The thumb
	of the right hand must lie along it, so that its tip is at
	A, the extreme end of the rasp. The hand is closed to
	hold it quite firm, and the tips of all the fingers, except
	the little one, will lie against the bottom of the sole at
	B, and so form a guard whilst rasping all round the sole.
	Held like this, the rasp is rubbed up and down, from
	C to D, for about three inches at a stroke, touching only
	the centre of the sole edge, and keeping clear of the welt
	edge E and the sole edge F, as the edge when finished
</p>

<p>
	[Page 125.]
</p>

<p>
	should be hollow, as at G. The edge is filed or rasped
	in the centre only, because the join of the welt and sole
	at H is the only portion of it that is hard, as the edges
	E and F are only the grain side of the welt and of the
	sole. The edge can be filled finally in like manner with
	the smooth side of the rasp; it should be finished level,
	and with the hollow nice and even all round.
</p>

<p>
	The sole-plane (Fig. 146), which costs 1s. 6d., is not
	in any way hard to use. It will be seen that A forms a
	rest and B a guard; under B is the knife C. In use, B is
</p>

<figure id="Figure144-145">
	<img src="Figures/144-145.png" />
	<figcaption>

		Fig. 145.--Rasping Edge of Sole.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	run on the edge in the same way that any other plane
	would be used, putting equal pressure on all round, or a
	little extra where most is needed off. This is an
	exceedingly good tool for a novice to use, as with it he
	cannot do much damage, whereas with the knife he can
	soon spoil a boot.
</p>

<p>
	With a very fine file again go all over the surfaces that
	have been rasped, more particularly at the heel. The
	process is as described above, so nothing further need be
	said about it here, only that it requires to be done well.
</p>

<p>
	The top of the top piece of the heel can be well filed
	with the file side of the rasp. The boot is held between
	the knees, in the position of Fig. 138, or reversed with
	the toe towards you; it must be held very firmly, with the
</p>

<p>
	[Page 126.]
</p>

<p>
	stirrup over the waist, and the file also must be held
	very firmly. That part where the nails are driven will
	want most filing, as the nails make this part highest,
	if the heel is built solid; the heel should be smooth and
	straight, and the edges left quite square.
</p>

<p>
	Previous to using the buffing-knife, which is
	described on this page, damp the edge of the sole, and
	lay the boot on its side to lie on your lap, with the sole
	towards you, and the toe towards the right. The buffing-knife
	D (Fig. 147) is held between the thumb and finger of
	the right hand, the other fingers, shown at A, are put
</p>

<figure id="Figure146-147">
	<img src="Figures/146-147.png" />
	<figcaption>
		Fig. 146.--Sole-plane.
		Fig. 147.--Shoemaker's Buffing-knife.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	on to the edge of the sole, the corner B being on the
	edge, while the finger C rests on the bottom of the sole.
	The top end of the buffing-knife should lean a little to
	the right. The buffing should be done, as much as
	possible, in the centre of the edge, so as to keep it hollow,
	as in rasping. This process will throw a burr over at E
	and F (Fig. 145).
</p>

<p>
	To sharpen a shoemaker's buffing-knife, run it through
	a piece of tallow, lay it flat on a board with the edge to
	be sharpened flush with the right-hand side edge of the
	board, and hold the knife on firmly by pressing all four
	fingers of the left hand upon it. With the stem of a
	sewing-awl, a stiletto, or a steel burnisher, rub the edge
	backwards and forwards. This will throw a burr over
	the edge. Turn the knife over, and repeat the process
	on the other side. Now hold the knife in the left hand,
</p>

<p>
	[Page 127.]
</p>

<p>
	edge upwards, and letting the awl run on Both the burrs
	at the same time, draw it from the centre to the corner;
	keep stroking the edge till it is flat. This will throw
	the burrs over the sides, and they will have a keen edge.
	Each time the buffing-knife is sharpened, it throws over
	a little more steel. Do not let other tools come in
	contact with it, as they may damage its edge.
</p>

<p>
	For buffing the heel the buffing-knife is held in the
	same way, excepting that the three fingers A (Fig. 147) are
	closed up to the palm of the hand. The knuckles will
	act as a rest to the knife while it is scraping the edge of
	the heel. If desired, the process of buffing the heel may
	be deferred till after the seat is set.
</p>

<p>
	Sand-papering is the next process, and a troublesome
	one it may prove if the sand-paper is not soft, even, and
	used in the proper place. To do the sand-papering of the
	sole, the boot can be held in the position of Fig. 137 for
	the last half, and in the reverse direction for the first
	half. A sheet of sand-paper costs a halfpenny, and folded
	uniformly it will make sixteen handy pieces. Double one
	of these rough side out, and hold it between the thumb
	and finger, as the buffing-knife in Fig. 145, except that
	the three fingers and the forefinger are closed in the palm
	of the hand, holding tlie paper between the thumb and
	the knuckle of the forefinger, and so far from the edge
	as to leave the paper under the thumb only. Supposing
	D to be the sand-paper, the folded edge should be at B,
	and being used upon the forepart, this edge must be
	nearest to the upper; but it must not touch it, nor
	must the hollowness in the edge be in the least interfered
	with.
</p>

<p>
	To sand-paper the heels the boot is held as at Fig. 142.
	The fingers may rest on the upper in the position shown,
	so that it cannot get rubbed; one of the small pieces of
	sand-paper is then placed across the fingers of the right
	hand, one end is slipped between the first and second
	finger, and the other between the third and fourth. The
	tips of the two middle fingers then form a pad for
	the paper to rest on, while the first and little fingers
</p>

<p>
	[Page 128.]
</p>

<p>
	hold it firm. It is then rubbed round the heel like
	the rasp was, again being careful of the two edges. A
	new piece of sand-paper, size 1-1/2 in., should be used first,
	and an old piece used to finish with.
</p>

<p>
	When the edge of the waist was peened as at C (Fig.
	138), the process ought to have knocked the welt very
	close to the upper. With the boot in the position shown
	in Fig. 137, hold the knife upright, and, commencing at
	the heel, and coming down to where the sole begins to
	get thick (A), cut away the edge of this welt in the
	waist. It will be only a very narrow strip, and as it was
	skived very thin, it will not be hard to cut. You must
	not cut very near the stitches, and take care not to slit
	the upper. With the boot in the reverse position, the
	same process is done on the other side in the same way,
</p>

<figure id="Figure148">
	<img src="Figures/148.png" />
	<figcaption>
		Fig. 148.--Welt-Knife.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	only this is done so that the sole C (Fig. 138) shall itself
	form the edge of the waist, which will then be solid.
</p>

<p>
	When this has been done, rub the bone round the
	waist, pene it down a little more, and repeat the action
	with the round head of the hammer, working all over
	until it is even and smooth. Then again trim the edge,
	keeping it a good shape, with the knife upright, so that
	on each margin the sole leather is of equal width from
	the upper. If it is then smooth, buff the waist all over,
	and afterwards sand-paper it.
</p>

<p>
	Levelling the welt comes next, and this is best done
	with the welt-knife, though it can be accomplished with
	an ordinary knife, placing the first finger of the right
	hand so that the blade tip and the finger tip form a V,
	and in this form the knife can be run round the welt
	without touching the upper. But if a welt-knife (Fig.
	148) is used, the welt can be trimmed well and easily, as
	A forms the knife, and B the guard to protect the upper,
	and if this tool is sharp it can be used with perfect ease,
</p>

<p>
	[Page 129.]
</p>

<p>
	to prepare for a double iron (Fig. 157), should this be
	desired.
</p>

<p>
	Breasting the heels--by which is meant the trimming
	up of the front of the heels--adds much beauty to
	a boot, and is one of the many points that makes
	shoe-making an art. For gentlemen's work, the breast is often
	cut straight across, as from A to B (Fig. 149), and for heavy
	work this is not objectionable; but for light work, or
	ladies', the boot or shoe is not properly finished until the
</p>

<figure id="Figure149">
	<img src="Figures/149.png" />
	<figcaption>
		Fig. 149.--Breasting the Heel and Marking the Waist.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	breasting is done. Previous to breasting, straighten the
	sides or corners of the heel, so that you may know
	where to commence each stroke and where to finish
	it; or the heel may be cut straight across, as from A to B
	(Fig. 149). Either way, the corners A and B must be
	straight from the seat to the top-piece.
</p>

<p>
	To breast out the heel a good sharp, stiff, narrow
	knife will be needed. This knife must be put in at
	C, and one sweep along the line D will take a piece, as E,
	out of the top-piece. Next comes the top lift, and this
	is cut away in front similarly with one sweeping curve.
	This is easier, as the leather is not so hard, and the
	curvature of the top-piece serves as a guide to rest
	the blade of the knife against while it is cutting. This
	process is continued till all the lifts are cut away; but
	with ths bottom lift F be very careful to cut only
</p>

<p>
	[Page 130.]
</p>

<p>
	just through it, and to avoid scoring the waist of the
	sole. The two ends of the split-lift can be cut away by
	a light pressure of the knife.
</p>

<p>
	To make up the seat after the seat has been nicely
	pared up, damp the leather and use the seat breaker,
	rubbing it evenly round the seat (Fig. 150) from A on the
	near corner to B on the far corner of the heel. The
	seat must be knifed-up very cleanly, as shown from
	A to C, all the stitches being entirely covered, and
	the extreme edge of the seat A C being close to the
	upper leather D. Following the breaker the seat-file
</p>

<figure id="Figure150">
	<img src="Figures/150.png" />
	<figcaption>
		Fig. 150.--Sole, Waist, and Top-piece set up.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	can be passed round the edge of the seat from A to B, to
	make it quite level where trimmed up. Then give it
	another rub with sand-paper should it need it.
</p>

<p>
	Slightly damp the edge of the seat again, and warm
	the seat-wheel (Fig. 151), but do not make it so hot that
	it would fizzle if put into water. Run the seat-wheel
	evenly round, so that it leaves at E (Fig. 150) one straight
	line of regular indentations.
</p>

<p>
	A seat-wheel is shown in section at Fig. 151. By
	looking at this illustration, it will be seen that A is the
	guard, which runs between the upper and seat at D
	(Fig. 150), while B, the wheel, rotates and makes the
	marks at E, in Fig. 150.
</p>

<p>
	Using waist-iron next, start at F (Fig. 150), and
	run it up and down, taking strokes of about 2 in., until
	B is reached; then finish the corner nicely, lightly press
	the iron down at A, and so finish the corner of the heel
	G, and by doing so finish the wheel marks E, so that
</p>

<p>
	[Page 131.]
</p>

<p>
	none are to be seen at B; and the process must be
	repeated on the further side.
</p>

<p>
	The leg of a common chair will make a very good

	handle for a waist-iron as shown at Fig. 152. The iron
	is placed in the handle at A, and the boot rests upon the

</figure>

<p>
	knees, in the position shown in Fig. 147. It can be held
	by the left hand while the iron is held at B, with the
	right; the end, C, can be placed against the right
	shoulder to form a centre, with the handle as the radius;
	describe an arc from F to A upon the edge of the waist
	(Fig. 150). This gives the iron a sweeping curve, which
	is necessary to give a good result.
</p>

<p>
	There are many kinds of waist-irons, as also of most
	other sorts of irons; but you need not be hampered with
	a quantity of tools, but may procure only those needed
</p>

<p>
	[Page 132.]
</p>

<p>
	as you progress with the work. To make a square waist,
	an iron similar to a double iron is used; for other waists,
	irons are used according to the shape required. These
</p>

		Fig. 153.--Hollow Waist-iron.
		Fig. 154.--Side-view of Waist-iron.
		Fig. l55.--Round Waist-iron.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	irons can be made from the ends of old files; these can
	be driven into handles, like Fig. 152. Figs. 153 and 155
	are two of the most useful; one is concave, and the
</p>

<figure id="Figure156-157">
	<img src="Figures/156-157.png" />
	<figcaption>

</figure>

<p>
	other convex. Both must be convex from the front, as
	shown in Fig. 154, where A is the guard, and B the part
	of the iron which sets up the edge.
</p>

<p>
	A double iron has two guards, marked A and B
	(Fig. 156), and A lies or runs on the welt, while B is on the
	top of the sole. So in ironing C will form a thin crease
	on the edge of the welt; and if the iron is held firm, D
</p>

<p>
	[Page 133.]
</p>

<p>
	will keep the edge hollow. This iron must be run very
	evenly, and must commence on the side opposite to the
	joint F (Fig. 150); it is run round the toe, and finished at
	E, on the near side. If not broken off too suddenly this
	will give a nice finish to the waist-iron, that started
	at this point.
</p>

<p>
	In a forepart, iron shown at Figs. 158 and 159, theF
</p>

<figure id="Figure158-159">

	<figcaption>

	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	guard must be shaped as A, the crease as B, and the face
	as C; this is done with very fine kit files. The face and
	guard can be cut with a three-cornered file; the face
	must be dome-shaped, as shown in Figs. 158 and 159;
	the top of the guard must be parallel to and about a
	1/4 in. above the face. A fine thin crease file will cut the
	crease B; this should be about 1/16 in. deep. A piece of
	soft sole leather oiled, and with some powdered emery
	on it, will soon put a smooth even face on the forepart
	iron.
</p>

<p>
	If the stitches are to be pricked up or fudged,
	Fig. 157 is used in exactly the same way. It is slightly
</p>

<p>
	[Page 134.]
</p>

<p>
	different in shape, for at a there is a little shoulder just
	above the crease, to give an even finish and sharp edge
	to the welt. This will remedy any irregularity made by
	the prick-stitch or fudge-wheel.
</p>

<p>
	If a double iron is to be used, tlie edge of the work
	must be specially prepared. The way in which a boot
	is stitched to a certain extent governs the shape of
	the iron to be used. For blind welts, Fig. 149 will be
	suitable.
</p>

<p>
	With regard to ironing, to get a good result in either
	sewn or stitched work, the forepart iron must be applied
	only on the sole side. The welt iron is to be used only
</p>

<figure id="Figure160">
	<img src="Figures/160.png" />
	<figcaption>
		Fig. 160.--Double Iron.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	on the welt side (from joint to joint), and it is often
	called a jigger-iron. The bevelled appearance is given
	to boot soles with this iron (or this may be done with
	the jigger side of a double iron).
</p>

<p>
	A welt iron is used for the welt-side of the sole's
	edge, and a forepart iron is used for the under-side only,
	and serves the purposes of both these tools. A double
	iron, shown at Fig. 157, is a welt and forepart iron
	combined; but it is much harder to learn to use.
</p>

<p>
	These irons should be only just warm, and the
	leather must be slightly damped before the iron is used,
	so as to give the edge a nice, polished, dark-brown
	surface.
</p>

<p>
	The whole edge of the heel H H (Fig. 150) can then be
	ironed in the same way, only this is done with the glazing
	or big iron (Fig. 30, p. 29). A good-shaped glazer has
	one end longer and thinner than the other; so that
	in ironing the waist it is easier to get in the breast of
</p>

<p>
	[Page 135.]
</p>

<p>
	the heel at F (Fig. 149); and other parts of the work are
	facilitated as well. This iron can be applied in a direction
	from H to H, or E to I (Fig. 150); but it must make no
	indentation to rob the surface of its truth. The top-piece
	iron is the next iron to apply. It is similar to
	a fore-part iron, only the face is not quite so round.
	This iron is run round the top-piece, and throws a crease
	at I (Fig. 150). It gives a keen finish all round, and it
	may also be run up each side at G.
</p>

<p>
	The fudge-wheel, as will be seen by A, at Fig.161,
	makes the stitches, or what represents them, appear nice
</p>

<figure id="Figure161">
	<img src="Figures/161.png" />
	<figcaption>
		Fig. 161.--Improved Fudge-wheel.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	and regular, which adds beauty to a boot. The fudge is
	finished off with the shoulder of the double iron A (Fig.
	157), when the edge is ironed; this shoulder will also
	finish off the prick-stitch when the stitch is pricked up.
</p>

<p>
	Fig. 161 shows an improved fudge-wheel, the shape
	of which enables it to be used more freely than the
	one shown at Fig. 61. As the wheel is tapering, its
	prominent edge will run much closer under the upper at
	that particular part which is marked A.
</p>

<p>
	A prick-stitch and how to make it is described on
	page 73, and on page 95 is shown, in Fig. 100, an enlarged
	section of stitching meant to be pricked up. The same
	is shown on a smaller scale at b (Fig. 162). Here the point
	of the prick-stitch (Fig. 79) must be pressed between
	every stitch, which makes a mark like the fudge, only
	that it throws up each separate stitch, and forms them
	into a row like little beads, instead of making a series
	of
</p>

<p>
	[Page 136.]
</p>

<p>
	raised ridges from the edge of the sole to the upper, as
	the fudge would have done. Fig. 162 shows the position
	of the boot for pricking up the stitch, and this is
	commenced at C, while fudging would be started on the
	opposite side of the sole.
</p>

<p>
	A blind welt will only want to be smoothed round
	with a dull knife and left plain, but not so wide, as at
	D. A welt that is half wide, three-quarter wide, or wide
	must be pricked up, or fudged, to look at all well.
</p>

<p>
	Marking off the waist is done simply to show the
	extremity of the waist, and how far to black when it is a
</p>

<p>
	black waist. It can be done in various forms to suit the
	taste. Two--the curve and double twirl--are shown at G
	(Fig. 149). All irons used in finishing a pair of boots
	should be applied prior to the colour going on.
</p>

<p>
	Putting the soles into colour is the next process, by
	which is meant putting the ink on. If they have been
	ironed, as just described, it is necessary to first rub on a
	little weak soda and warm water, or weak ammonia and
	water, the parts to be made black to make the ink take,
	or strike, as it is technically termed. The parts are then
	inked according to fancy--that is, the welt, edge, waist,
	heel, seat, etc. American ink is best diluted with an
	equal quantity of water. If the leather is not ironed
	while in the brown, the soda-water or ammonia-water
	will not be needed; but a little thin paste or gum is run
	over to make the edges smooth to receive the ink, and

	prevent it opening the pores of the leather. Either must
	be used very sparingly. When the boots have been got
	into colour, let them get only just dry, when they will be
	ready to iron. If American ink was used this will be
	when nearly the whole of the inked parts will have
	turned blue.
</p>

<p>
	In all ironing, the boot or shoe must be held very
	firmly upon the knees, and the irons must be only
	slightly hot, or they will wrinkle the edge and spoil
	it; therefore the iron will want a continuation of
	heating all through the process. Take great care of

<p>
	all irons, for if they get damaged, it will be useless to
	expect them to woik well and leave a keen edge behind
	them.
</p>

<p>
	So that your irons will not get smoked and dirty
	your work, the proper way to heat them is either over a
	spirit-lamp or a specially prepared atmospheric gas-jet
	which burns only with a blue flame. If the irons have
	to be heated in a fire be very careful, or the handles may
	be burnt. Even though the irons are heated in this way,
	it is well to have an old piece of rag just to wipe them
	on each time before using.
</p>

<p>
	Fig. 163 is a sixpenny spirit-lamp made for this
	purpose, A being a cap fitting the burner, to prevent
	evaporation of the spirit; B, a rim fitting on the lamp
	to support the stand, while the iron C is being heated.
</p>

<p>
	[Page 138.]
</p>

<p>
	Heating the irons will waste time unless while using
	the small irons the glazer is kept just warm enough
	to be used on the waist and the heel during the
	intervals while the small ones are getting hot.
</p>

<p>
	The irons must be held very firmly in the right
	hand, and upright so that only the centre part touches
	the leather, otherwise the surface will be roughed
	through the edges of the irons dragging. They must
	press very hardly, but uniformly, all over the leather, or
	they will make hills and dales of what should be a
	plane. The way to use the irons, so that one will give a
	finishing stroke to the other, has been explained--this
	course must be adhered to both in the second and third
	ironing. These are a repetition of that explained as
	the first, only that the work is black instead of brown;
	all parts must be well ironed, so that there is not a patch
	of dull black left anywhere.
</p>

<p>
	When a good gloss has been got on all parts, heat
	over your lamp one side of a hard heel-ball, and while
	this is in a semi-liquid state dab small portions of it all
	over the ironed portions, excepting just round the
	seat where the seat-wheel is set. Then, with the irons
	a degree cooler than before, repeat the two previous
	operations at the same time, ironing the heel-ball evenly
	all over. The irons must be warm enough to soften
	the heel-ball with a very little pressure, or indentations
	will be made in the leather, and the edges and surface
	spoiled.
</p>

<p>
	In all ironing it is well to habitually use a certain
	method, so that you may have an instinctive conception
	of results, and save repeating an operation unnecessarily.
	Use glazing iron (Fig. 30, p. 29) first, then wheel (Fig.
	151), so that the former shall not destroy the latter.
	Now using the waist-iron (Fig. 153), press it a little
	harder at the end of the waists and into the corner of
	the seats, and so give a decided finish to waist, and also
	press out any marks that the wheel may have made, thus
	giving the seat the appearance of having had each piece
	nicely finished at its corners.
</p>

<p>
	[Page 139.]
</p>

<p>
	Now use the prick-stitch (Fig. 79) if the stitches are
	to be pricked up; if fudged, use the fudge-wheel (Fig.
	161); if blind welts, smooth down with a dull knife.
	Then setting the double iron (Figs. 157 and 160) round
	the edge will finish off either of these, and if neither
	started nor finished off too abruptly this will give a nice
	finish to the waist-iron also.
</p>

<p>
	The heel-ball spread over all the blacked parts will
	want cleaning off with a cloth--a piece of old beaver or
	kersey is about the best for this purpose, though other
	kinds will do. This cloth is doubled, and then placed
	over your right thumb, the ends are brought round so
	that you can hold them firmly in the hand, and so make
	a smooth pad of cloth upon the thumb, as Fig. 164, and
</p>

<figure id="Figure164">
	<img src="Figures/164.png" />
	<figcaption>
		Fig. 164.--Holding Heel-ball Cloth.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	with this rub the parts where the heel-ball is, and
	continue gently rubbing till the whole of it is cleaned off,
	leaving a smooth, even, glossy surface. This process
	can then be repeated with an old piece of soft rag held
	in the same way.
</p>

<p>
	The bottoms and top-pieces of stout work are sometimes
	made black, and if finished in this way they look
	very nice if done well. Other styles are also given here.
</p>

<p>
	For black bottoms, waists, and top-pieces the entire
	bottom will have to be scraped with the buffing-knife,
	and sand-papered till it is very smooth. Then a little
	thin paste or gum should be rubbed over it carefully to
</p>

<p>
	[Page 140.]
</p>

<p>
	make it smooth. When dry, it can be polished all over
	with a cold burnisher or a boxwood long-stick. Then
	ink it in the same way as for the other parts.
</p>

<p>
	The waists may be treated similarly, except that it is
	better in this case to use a hot burnisher, of the shape
	shown in Fig. 165. This is also easier to use than the
</p>

<figure id="Figure165">

	<figcaption>
		Fig. i65.--Double-handed Burnisher or Glazer.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	glazing iron for this purpose, as a handle in each hand
	and the boot between the knees give much more power
	over the tool. The waist is heel-bulled and finished in
	the same way as the edges.
</p>

<p>
	Buff bottoms and waists, which are easily dirtied
	and easily cleaned, are made as just described, but
	stopping short of inking, and instead a little powdered
	pumice-stone is rubbed on, first with the face of the
	sand-paper, and then with the back of it.
</p>

<p>
	Damped-down bottoms do not get dirty so quickly,
	and give a nice clean-looking finish; the process is a
	repetition of the above, only instead of paste or pumice
	the bottom is smoothed with a pad of damp, clean,
	white flannel.
</p>

<p>
	White bottoms are prepared in the same way as buff
	ones, only instead of using pumice a little pipe-clay is
	scraped on, and sand-papered in, and when even all
	over, it is damped down with a piece of clean white
	flannel. Another coat of pipe-clay is then scraped over,
	and dabbed in with a dry part of the flannel. This
	will dry with a clean, white, smooth surface, and then
	any surplus pipe-clay can be rubbed off with the dry
	flannel.
</p>

<p>
	Fiddle waists for light work look as clean and nice
	as any, and this process can be extended all over the
	bottom. This kind of waist is generally used with a
</p>

<p>
	[Page 141.]
</p>

<p>
	stripe-waist--that is, the parts A and B (Fig. 166),
	are made black. A light-coloured shoe is left brown,
	then the stripes can be made a little darker by the use
	of a warm iron. Fig. 167 shows a gent's boot, but a
	lady's looks even better, because the stripes can be made
	a little wider at A and B, which makes the waist look
	narrower and much smarter.
</p>

<p>
	These waists must be buffed and sand-papered in
	the usual way, and rubbed down with the back of the
	sand-paper to make them very smooth. A piece of
	clean white rag is drawn over the thumb of the right
	hand, as in Fig. 164, so that the rag is quite smooth on
	the cushion of the thumb. It can be held firmly with
	the forefinger, just under A. On this pad is put a little
	clean paste, and this is rubbed very lightly and very
	evenly all over the part to be fiddled. See that one
	place is not made damper than another, or the waist
	will look mottled when done. Instead of paste, this
	can also be done with a clear gum, or, better still, a
</p>

<figure id="Figure166">
	<img src="Figures/166.png" />

</p>

<p>
	gum-dragon; a pennyworth from the chemist's, put
	into a small jar, and covered with water, will be ready
	for use in a few hours.
</p>

<p>
	When the waist is dry, rub it all over with a bone or
	long-stick, holding the boot firmly between the knees,
	and one end of the bone in each hand. Keep rubbing
	till the whole waist is nicely polished, then change the
	rag shown in Fig. 164 for a piece of clean cloth, and
	upon this rub some white glazing-ball (which is white
	heel-ball), and rub this all over the parts that have been
	covered with gum or paste until a good even creamy
	polish is got by rubbing evenly and briskly.
</p>

<p>
	To make the stripe waist, the knife must be held as
	a pen in the right hand, and the boot in the left, with
	the toe towards you, as in Fig. 166. The point of the
	knife is then put in at C, and drawn round the line B to
	D. The position of the boot is then reversed, and the
	other side treated in a like manner, to make the line A.
	The knife must go only just through the grain of the
	leather, say 1/32 of an inch. Though the knife is held as
	a pen, the handle should point over the left shoulder,
	so that the burr or thin edge of the cut-up grain
	shall form a barrier to prevent the ink flowing on
	to the fiddled part while the stripes are being inked.
</p>

<p>
	When the bottoms are finished by this method, the
	top-pieces may also be finished in the same way, or they
	may be made black. Another good finish is to use a
	little ink and a few pieces of oxalic acid, and rub them
	all over with the end of a wine cork; this makes a bright
	red top-piece, the more ink used the darker it is, or a
	little water added makes it much lighter.
</p>

<p>
	Spring waist, either pegged or sewn should be
	finished as follows:--After the ordinary ink is on and
	dried, a piece of damp rag is used to rub off all surplus
	ink or dross; with the same rag rub a little Indian
	ink on all over the waist. When dry, in a minute or so
	after, rub it over with a dry cloth, and this will leave a
	smooth dull surface. This is ironed or lined across with
	a crease iron or a dull knife. With the former two or
</p>

<p>
	[Page 143.]
</p>

<p>
	three lines may be made at a time, but with the latter
	only one. As very few are used, the iron now is rather
	hard to obtain, the dull knife being as quick in the end.
	With this line the waist as shown in Fig. 167, commencing
</p>

<p>
	at the line A in the centre, and then making lines on
	either side until both ends are reached. When ironing
	up, give all the lines a finish by using the waist-iron up
	each side.
</p>

<p>
	In marking off the length of the waist, as E (Fig. 166),
	the end of the line on either side is brought just over the
	commencement of the thick part of the edge and the end
	of the waist, as shown at a (Fig. 168.) The fudging or

<p>
	pricking-up of the stitch, should start at B, and the wheel
	top-piece iron (if used down the line C), and waist-iron
	should all finish at D. The line from E to F should have
	straight and even sweeps, the height of heel making a
	difference in these. These points help to make a boot
	look well.
</p>

<p>
	The burnisher, or double-handled glazer (Fig. 165),
	is a handy tool, as much more pressure can be got upon
</p>

<p>
	[Page 144.]
</p>

<p>
	it than on an ordinary iron, and being larger it holds the
	heat longer. The top at a can be used for the heels,
	top-piece, the bottom, and some part of the waist; the side
	at B is used only for the heels, and the part C rests upon
	the top-piece. For making black bottoms this tool is
	almost indispensable. It is possible to make one by
	heating and beating out the teeth of an old half-round
	file, and rubbing it down smooth in the centre, and then
	putting another handle on the point.
</p>

<p>
	When drawing the last out of lace boots, cut the stay
	stitches, which hold the two facings together on the
	instep. If button boots, undo the buttons and cut the
	stays at the edge of the fly lining. The screw of the
	block must be taken out and the last hook (Fig. 169) put
</p>

	<figcaption>
		Fig. 169.--Last Hook.

</figure>

<p>
	in the hole in the side of the block, and it can then be
	drawn out. The hook can then be put in a hole made
	for it just over the heel the last; the upper should be
	quite smooth, so that the last cannot catch it anywhere
	and tear the linings.
</p>

<p>
	Your two feet must be put on the handle of the last
	hook, the boot should be held with the toe raised in the
	left hand, the heel of the boot can then be pulled off the
	last with the right hand. In doing this care must be
	taken not to break the waist, and it is sometimes
	necessary to pull the upper right back over the heel of
	the last, to save the waist from being bent. If the last
	is exceedingly hard to get out, it can be eased a little by
</p>

<p>
	[Page 145.]
</p>

<p>
	gently tapping it on either side of the forepart, but take
	care not to bruise the upper.
</p>

<p>
	There is sure to be some roughness on the insides.
	When the waist or seats are not pegged, this can be
	removed by rubbing a peg-rasp (Fig. 170) over the rough
</p>

<figure id="Figure170">
	<img src="Figures/170.png" />
	<figcaption>
		Fig. 170.--Round-headed Peg-Rasp.

<p>
	place. If the insides are very rough, or when the seats
	or waists have been pegged, they must be well scraped
	with a peg-knife (Fig. 171) until all the points are off.
</p>

<figure id="Figure171">
	<img src="Figures/171.png" />
	<figcaption>
		Fig. 171. -Peg-Knife.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	Any nails inside should be knocked down previous to
	this process, or they will spoil the peg-knife. After the
	pegs are cut off, rub the whole of the inner-sole down
	with the peg-rasp. These two tools are very handy, as
	a pair of boots that have been worn some time often
	become uneven inside, and application of the peg-knife
	and peg-rasp may save a lot of discomfort.
</p>

<p>
	Gent's boots or shoes will only want a seat-sock, as
	Fig. 172. For shoes lined with dry-dressed leather, a piece

	<figcaption>
		Fig. 172.--Seat-sock for Gent's Boots.

<p>
	to match it can be used for a sock. If oil-dressed, or if
	boots, a piece of cream roan or a piece of any coloured

</p>

<p>
	morocco will do. They should be cut the shape of Fig.
	172, a trifle larger than the inner-sole, which is shown by
	the dotted lines. Both boots and shoes for ladies are
	socked right through, and this makes such a great difference
	to the finish of them. It is best when the fitting of
	the inner-sole is finished to take it off the last, lay it on
	a sheet of paper and cut this exactly to the sole (Fig.
</p>

	173), except at A and B where it should be a little large,
	particularly at B, the inside waist.
</p>

<p>
	Paste the socks on the wrong side of the leather, and
	only to within an eighth of an inch of the edge, as when
	the sock is pressed in the boot the paste is sure to work
	out to the edge, and if too much paste is used it will
	ooze out beyond, and if it comes in contact with the
	linings it makes them very dirty. A thin stick about a
	foot and a half long, tapered at one end, is used to put
	in socks. In this stick put a stout needle, passing the
	eye up into the wood so that there is only about a
	quarter of an inch left out. After the sock is pasted,
	put this needle point, from the paste side, through the
	toe of the sock, lay it along the paste side, as shown by
	Fig. 174, fold the sock, letting the clean side be at the

	touching each other. By this simple means the toe of
</p>

<p>
	[Page 147.]
</p>

<p>
	the sock can be got right to the toe end of the boot, and
	the whole sock right in, without dirt or puste getting on
	the linings or top-bands. When the sock is up at the
	toe, press the boot on the top of the toe so as to hold the
	sock there while the point of the needle is drawn out,
	and when this is done, nicely lay the sock all over the
	inner-sole; see that it is in straight. Then put your
	hand in and smooth it down all over. If the leather for
	the socks is thick, it must be skived at the edge all
	round, but if not very thick, cut the socks face
	downwards, and hold the knife pretty fairly on the slant,
	letting the handle always incline towards the centre.
	When the sock is in there will not be a rough edge
	showing all round, as is the case sometimes.
</p>

<p>
	To tap down the feather, take hold of the boot or
	shoe in the centre of the front or vamp with the left
	hand, and pinch it so that all the stuff is away from the
	sides, and while it is in this position, tap it down very
	lightly on either side with a smooth-headed hammer.
	This is to make the feather of the inner-sole even each
	side, and to lay it, with the upper, closer to the outer
	sole, and so give it the appearance of having been
	worked closer than it really was.
</p>

<p>
	Your boots or shoes are now ready to wear, with the
	exception of cleaning. A very thin coat of weak
	paste will save you a lot of trouble in cleaning calf.
	This should be put on while they are on the lasts, and
	while they are there the first coat of blacking will save
	a lot of trouble afterwards, as you can then well sleek
	them with a piece of smooth bone, to give them a smooth
	and even face. The foregoing instructions refer mainly
	to an ordinary pair of boots or shoes, a few incidental
	remarks and instructions as to spring waists, etc., being
	included.

<h2>
	CHAPTER IX.
</h2>

<h3>
	MAKING RIVETED BOOTS AND SHOES.
</h3>

<p>
	When once the principles of lasting, explained in
	Chapter V., are understood, the process of making
	riveted boots and shoes is by no means a difficult one.
	It is a very ready way, and also a very cheap way, of
	making a good strong covering for the foot.
</p>

<p>
	Riveted work will need a last made of iron, or one
	having an iron bottom, which may be made by putting
	an iron plate upon an ordinary wooden last. If making
	for your own feet only, the latter would be best. If
	making for customers, buy iron lasts, one at a time, till
	a set of sizes is obtained. If making for your
	own children, who naturally grow out of boots very
	quickly, it is well to use an ordinary wooden last. In
	this case be very careful not to use the rivets too long,
	and when off the last, clench the rivets on a small iron
	foot.
</p>

<p>
	On p. 64 will be found all the information needed
	for buying the lasts and fitting them up to the measure
	of the foot. A thin sheet of iron, as Fig. 175, with three
	holes in it, at A, A, and A, can be made to cover the
</p>

<figure id="Figure175">
	<img src="Figures/175.png" />
	<figcaption>
		Fig. 175.--Thin Sheet Iron to cover Last.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	whole of the bottom. The sheet-iron should be blocked
	so as to fit the last's bottom perfectly. It can be held
</p>

<p>
	[Page 149.]
</p>

<p>
	on by six screws, as shown by the six B's. This will
	allow the iron to be taken off when the last is wanted to
	make hand-sewn work on.
</p>

<p>
	This sheet of iron would make the boots too large;
	but this is remedied by putting a pair of extra inner soles,
	the thickness of the sheet-iron. These soles, blocked
	and dried on the last, make a pair of riveted boots as
	smooth as hand-sewn inside.
</p>

<p>
	The inner sole proper is tacked at A, A, A, Fig. 176,
</p>

<figure id="Figure176">
	<img src="Figures/176.png" />
	<figcaption>
		Fig. 176.--Boot Bottom with Blinders and Split-lift on Heel.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	and rounded up to the last. It is skived down a little
	at the waist only, and then merely at the edge.
</p>

<p>
	Chapter IV. (p. 70) gives information on buying the
	tops and sole leather; but for riveted work welts are not
	wanted, but, instead, a piece of soft first-cut about 14 in.
	long and 2 in. wide. This treated like split-lifts will
	make a pair of runners. Proceed to wet and fit it as
	described for welts; but it must be used nearly dry,
	and the stiffeners can be skived on the bottom the same
	as on the top.
</p>

<p>
	The principles of lasting are the same as those
	described in Chapter V., to which reference should be
	made; but for riveted work use very short tingles
	(miniature tin-tacks), in place of lasting tacks; and
	instead of these being put in as shown at B, B, D, D, and
	C (Fig. 87, p. 78), they are put in at the extreme edge of
	the overlapping leather, and are knocked right in and
	clenched. Also, in lasting for riveting, the heel of the
	last must be knocked into the top more at D (Fig. 84,
	p. 75), so that there is enough stuff for the rivets to
	catch while building the heel; the heel should be lasted
</p>

<p>
	[Page 150.]
</p>

<p>
	in nearly as well as the toe, so that when the lasting is
	finished the upper shonid be quite smooth all round.
	The centre should be filled up with a little felt, and the
	whole bottom made fiat and level all over. The way to
	put the felt and the shank-piece in the waist is described
	on p. 52.
</p>

<p>
	For a boot of very light substance, the sole can now
	be put on; but to make medium or stout boots, put on
	the runner, or put on a middle sole, and then skive the
	centre of it a little. If the runner is put on, it will need
	preparing in the same way as a split-lift, described on
	p. 99, only the twist will not be wanted up the sides, but
	merely at the toe end, or centre, of the runner. It must
	be tingled on all round, not using many tingles, and
	these as far from the edge as possible, so that while the
	sole is being put on, the rivets will not come in contact
	with and drive them through, and so tend to make the
	sole unsolid. The position of the runner is shown by A,
	B, C (Fig. 177), the ends can be skived off at A and C.

<p>
	If a middle sole is used, it is put all over the fore-part
	as far as A, C, where it will also want skiving. To
	fit the sole on while rounding it up, put in a few iron
	brads about 1/2 in. long--not rivets--and leave them
	projecting about 1/8 in., or little more, as shown by the
	short strokes near the A's in Fig. 176; file up these till
	they are somewhat pointed, then the centre and the
	edge can be pasted.
</p>

<p>
	A pair of soles of inferior quality towards the heel
	would be less costly; with these it is best to make the
	seat with a pair of good split-lifts instead of with the
	soles. The split-lifts can be bradded on, as shown by B,
</p>

<p>
	[Page 151.]
</p>

<p>
	B, B, with 1/2 in. brads, and they can be driven in and
	clenched. The runner or the split-lift can be rounded
	up all round, to within 3/16 in. of the upper. This allows
	enough in the forepart to imitate a welt and to make
	the seat at the heel.
</p>

<p>
	The sole is now pasted, and laid on its place, and
	a brad driven in at C, Fig. 176. It can then be tapped
	down all over with the flat end of the hammer, first
	striking gently over each of the brads marked A, and
	then continuing till it is all flat and smooth, as Fig. 178.
</p>

<figure id="Figure177">
	<img src="Figures/178.png" />
	<figcaption>
		Fig. 178.--The Riveted Sole.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	The sole is now rounded up to the runner and split-lift,
	and to within 1/8 in. of the upper at the waist on each
	side; all this should be done to give as good form to the
	boot as possible.
</p>

<p>
	The instruction to leave on 3/16 in. all round the
	fore-part must be qualified. Do so, if the wearer wears
	straight; if, however, he wears unevenly, leave the stuff
	a little full where the most wear comes, and trim it
	close on the other side.
</p>

<p>
	Now rivet the sole on. If not used to driving rivets,
	make holes to receive them, and in doing this, and in
	driving the rivets, see that their points incline distinctly
	inward, or the rivets may run off the edge of the last
	instead of clenching. If the work is light, the holes can
	be made near to the edge, as the sole will in this case
	need to be a shade closer; while for stout work the
	rivets can be a trifle farther from the edge of the sole.
	A second row may be put all round, or only at E and F;
	but the single row even would be enough for light
	work.
</p>

<p>
	[Page 152.]
</p>

<p>
	If the heel part is not flat, it is better to put a second
	split-lift on the sole; or the first whole lift may be put
	on, skiving away the centre till it fits. How to finish
	building the heels, and the way to brad the top piece,
	is described on pp. 114, 115.
</p>

<p>
	If the boots have been made upon wood lasts,
	without iron on them, at this stage the last should be
	withdrawn, the whole of the bottom tapped down on
	the iron foot, and the last then replaced. The rivets
	may be driven with a hammer, but it is easier to do this
	with a beater, as shown on p. 122, or with a driver like
	Fig. 179, which is a patent rivet-driver (price 1s. 6d.,
</p>

<figure id="Figure179">
	<img src="Figures/179.png" />
	<figcaption>
		Fig. 179.--Rivet Driver.

</figure>

<p>
	made of hardened steel). A similar one can be made by
	heating an old long rasp, and beating it somewhat
	smooth, and then re-tempering it.
</p>

<p>
	Knifing-up, rasping, buffing, sand-papering, etc.,
	breasting heels, seat setting, finishing-off waist, setting-up
	fudge-wheel on welt (or runner in this case), putting
	into colour, and finishing, etc., are explained in
	Chapter VIII.
</p>

<p>
	Having followed these directions, the boots are off
	the last, and all that is now necessary is to sock them.
	If made on last to the correct size, sock them as
	described on p. 146; if made upon the wood last with the
	extra iron bottom, sock them with a second inner sole.
	Take the sheet iron off the last, block the sock, let it
	dry, and then round and skive it up. Paste it well all
	over the flesh side, put it in the boot. Replace the last
	without the iron in the boot, and let the sock dry before
	taking out the last. French chalk can be shaken in the
	boot to prevent the last sticking to the sock and pulling
	it out.
</p>

<p>
	[Page 153.]
</p>

<p>
	While the boots are on the last they may be cleaned,
	as they will not be soiled by taking out the last this
	time.
</p>

<p>
	To avoid repeating information that has already
	appeared, references have been given above to pages
	in which some of the processes connected with boot
	and shoe making are described.
</p>

<p>
	In making riveted, pegged, or machine-sewn boots,
	the tops are cut longer and wider than they would
	be for hand-sewn work. From 1/4 in. to 1/2 in. more
	stuff is left on all round the bottom of the uppers. In
	this class of work the rivets, pegs, or stitches are nearer
	the centre of the sole than hand-sewing is. The welt
	is sewn in nearer the edge, and any upper leather
	above the seam has to be cut off close to the welt. As
	a rule, the leather is not subjected to any special
	treatment to soften it, though, if very stubborn, it can be
	made softer by damping it with water.
</p>

<p>
	All leather will form wrinkles and pipes in lasting
	at the toe especially, at the extreme edge of the leather.
	Any other work is easier to last than hand-sewn, in
	which there is only just enough upper leather to hold
	with the pincers. While lasting the toe, put a few tingles
	in only, say, one in the centre, then the draft tacks, one
	on each side. Last up the lining first, knocking the
	tingles only just through the inner sole, so that they may
	be drawn out when lasting the upper. When doing this,
	see that you last the lining smooth previous to proceeding
	with the upper. Then place a tingle between the
	centre and draft tacks. There will now be a pucker
	on each side; these you try to tap or hammer out
	before putting in more tacks. Every tack put in after
	should be through the top of one of these pipes, or
	puckers; and when the toe has enough tacks in it, well
	hammer it all round, starting at the edge of the sole, and
	working towards its centre, till you get to the edge of
	the toe-leather. All the pipes will not be got out by this
	means, so cut a V-piece out of each remaining, and then
	tap it down again, or the tops of the ridges may be
</p>

<p>
	[Page 154.]
</p>

<p>
	skived off. In either case, cut only to within about
	3/8 in. or 1/4 in. of the edge of the last, so that the rivets,
	pegs, or stitches shall have firm and solid leather to go
	through. By the above means light leather topS can
	be lasted without the use of the knife at all.
</p>

<p>
	This chapter may conclude with a few recipes which
	the shoemaker is sure to find useful at some time or
	other.
</p>

<p>
	SHOEMAKERS' SIZE.--This is made in the following
	manner: Ingredients, 1/4 lb. yellow soap, twopenny-worth
	of glue, and one quart of soft water. Process: Cut the
	soap up fine, and break the glue into small pieces; put
	them into a saucepan, and pour the water over them;
	put it on the lire, and well stir it till it just boils. Pour
	it out into another vessel to cool. It is then ready for
	use.
</p>

<p>
	BURNISHING INK.--To make good burnishing ink,
	you will hardly be likely to better the following, which
	is an American recipe: One pint of alcohol, 1-1/2 oz. of
	tincture of iron, 1 oz. of extract of logwood, 1 oz. of
	pulverised nut-galls, 1/2 pt. of soft water, and 1/2 oz. of
	sweet oil; the oil mnst be mixed with the alcohol prior
	to adding the water and other ingredients.
</p>

<p>
	Another: Soft water, 1 gallon; bring it to a boil,
	and add 8 ozs. of pulverised logwood extract, keeping it
	on the fire for three minutes only; then remove, and
	stir in 2-1/2 oz. of gum arabic, 1 oz. of bichromate of
	potash, and 80 grs. of prussiate of potash.
</p>

<p>
	Another: Soft water, 1 gallon; extract of logwood,
	1 oz.; boil till the extract is dissolved, take from the
	fire, and add 2 ozs. of copperas and 1/2 oz. each of
	bi-chromate of potash and gum arabic, all well powdered.
</p>

<p>
	BLACK AND WHITE HEEL-BALLS.--To make black
	heel-balls, take 8 ozs. of the best beeswax and 1 oz. of
	tallow, melt, and well stir; then add 1 oz. of very finely
	powdered gum arabic, stir again, and mix in lampblack
	to colour. Another and better recipe is to melt together
	2 lbs. of best beeswax aud 3 ozs. of suet, and stir in 4 ozs.
</p>

<p>
	[Page 155.]
</p>

<p>
	of ivory black and 3 ozs. of lampblack; then add 2 ozs. of
	finely-powdered gum arabic (best) and 2 ozs. of rock
	candy. These must be well mixed, and, when partly
	cold, poured into leaden moulds to the shape and size
	you wish.
</p>

<p>
	For white or bottom ball, leave out the above
	colours, and if wanted only as a tranparent polish this
	will suffice; but if needed as a white substance, add a
	little flake white.
</p>

<p>
	SHOEMAKER'S WAX.--Take 4 ozs. of pitch, 1 oz. of
	resin, and about a 1/4 oz. of good tallow, and heat them
	well on a slow fire in a pipkin or old saucepan. Be very
	careful they do not take fire, as they are very
	combustible. Stir this admixture till the resin has melted
	and mixed well with the other ingredients; then pour
	the whole into a pail of cold water, and when it has got
	sufficiently cool to handle, put one hand underneath,
	and with the other turn the edges over to the centre,
	to make the mixture into one ball. Take it out, and
	make it into a roll. Take one end in each hand, and
	pull it out as long as you can without breaking it.
	Double it, and pull out again and again; the more it is
	pulled (or worked), the better and brighter it will be.
	This done, lay it out on a slab, seeing it does not stick.
	Roll it out, cut it into strips about 1 in. wide, and
	cut the strips into pieces about 1-1/2 in. long; each
	piece is called a ball. Wax has to be made hard in
	warm weather, and soft in cold. To make it softer,
	add more tallow; to make hard, use more resin. It is
	best to make it hard, as it can easily be made soft
	without being again heated--simply by working a little
	tallow into it. The balls of wax should always be kept
	in water, to prevent their sticking to anything or to
	each other.
</p>

<p>
	MAKING FAKE.--Fake is not sold ready for use, but
	it can be made in the following way: Take two hard
	heel-balls and about two-thirds of a white glazing ball,
	break them up into small pieces, and put them into a
	small tin box. Proper fake tins can be bought; any
</p>

<p>
	[Page 156.]
</p>

<p>
	tin will do, but the deeper the rim of the lid is the
	better, as it will prevent the spirit evaporating when
	not in use. Just cover the contents of the tin with
	mineral naptha, and then put the whole on the hob or
	in the oven; but the fire must not be fierce, the lid
	must not be on the box, and it must be well watched,
	for this process, of course, rarefies the spirit and
	intensifies its inflammability. The use of fake is to lessen
	the labour in finishing, for if heel-ball is ironed on, it
	is very hard to rub off. It is used after the edge has
	been knifed, rasped, scraped, sand-papered, inked, dried,
	and nicely ironed with warm irons, which gives it, in
	itself, a good gloss. The fake is rubbed on with the
	finger, and when it has set a little, it should be rubbed
	off with a soft cloth till it leaves a bright even jet-black
	gloss. Brown work is finished in the same way, and
	the fake is made just the same, only all white ball is
	used, and not any heel ball.
